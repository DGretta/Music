**The Mysterious Organismic Effects Processor**

---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Sound in 5 Minutes

**What is Lyra8-FX?** The effects section from Soma's legendary Lyra-8 "Organismic Synthesizer" packed into a Eurorack module. It's a dual lo-fi delay with cross-feedback plus parallel distortion that creates murky, sludgy, mysterious textures unlike any other effects processor. Think broken speakers, rusty delays, and living, breathing effects.

### Your First Organismic Processing
1. **Turn IN volume** to around 12 o'clock
2. **Set both Stage delays** to around 1 o'clock
3. **Turn Delay mix** to 2 o'clock (more wet)
4. **Set Delay feedback** to 11 o'clock (moderate)
5. **Patch any audio source** ‚Üí **Audio In**
6. **Listen** - you should hear murky, lo-fi delay processing
7. **Slowly turn up Distortion drive** - adds gritty parallel distortion

### Discover Self-Modulation Magic
1. **Flip Stage 1 mod source switch** to **self-modulation** position
2. **Turn Stage 1 mod depth** to 2 o'clock
3. **Increase feedback** to 3 o'clock
4. **Result:** The delay modulates its own sample rate - creating unstable, degraded textures!

## Beginner "Gotchas" & Pro Tips

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:**

**"The effect sounds too subtle/clean!"**
- Lyra8-FX is designed for character, not transparency
- **Solution:** Push feedback higher, use self-modulation, increase distortion

**"The delays don't sync to my tempo!"**
- This isn't a tempo-synced delay - it's designed for organic, non-quantized timing
- **Solution:** Embrace the non-synced character, or use external CV for rhythmic control

**"It sounds broken/unstable!"**
- This is intentional - "organismic" means unpredictable and alive
- **Solution:** Learn to work with the instability as a musical element

### **üéµ Pro Tips:**

**Self-Modulation Sweet Spots:**
