# Make Noise Wogglebug - Beginner's Guide
*Your Synthesizer's ID Monster - Source of Musical Uncertainty*

---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Sound in 5 Minutes

**What is Wogglebug?** A "Source of Uncertainty" that generates stepped and smooth random voltages, giving your synthesizer a mind of its own. Based on the legendary Buchla 265, it's **controlled chaos** that makes static sequences come alive with unpredictable, musical movement. Think of it as your synthesizer's "ID" - the unconscious element that adds life to electronic music.

### Your First Taste of Chaos (Basic Random CV)
1. **Turn Speed/Chaos knob** to 12 o'clock position
2. **Turn Ego/Id Balance** to 3 o'clock (full randomness)
3. **Watch the blue System Clock LED** blink - this shows the sample rate
4. **Patch Stepped Output** → your oscillator's 1V/Oct input
5. **Patch Smooth Output** → your filter cutoff CV input
6. **Play with Speed/Chaos knob** - notice how it changes both speed AND character!

### Discover the Audio Chaos (Wogglebug as Sound Source)
1. **Patch Smooth VCO Output** → your mixer (it's a "shark's fin" wave oscillator)
2. **Patch Ring-Mod Output** → another mixer channel
3. **Turn up the volume** - you're hearing the Wogglebug's "uncertain beating heart"
4. **Adjust Speed/Chaos** - watch how the audio changes character completely
5. **This is additive synthesis** controlled by chaos circuits - unlike anything else!

## Essential Parameters (The Big 4)

### **1. Speed/Chaos Control (The Paradox Knob)**
- **What it does:** Controls both clock rate AND character simultaneously
- **Range:** 1 minute per cycle up to 40Hz (200Hz with +8V CV)
- **CCW (9-11 o'clock):** Slow + smooth, musical randomness
- **12-2 o'clock:** Medium speed + some jitter, good for rhythmic work
- **CW (3+ o'clock):** Fast + chaotic, digital noise territory
- **Key insight:** This isn't just speed - it fundamentally changes the chaos character!

### **2. Ego/Id Balance (Consciousness vs. Unconscious)**
- **What it does:** Controls how "clustered" vs. "spread out" random values are
- **Full CCW:** Values cluster together (more predictable, less random)
- **Full CW:** Full spread across entire range (maximum chaos)
- **With Ego Input:** Balances external control vs. internal randomness
- **Psychology:** "Ego" = your conscious control, "Id" = unconscious chaos

### **3. Woggle Control (The Unique Element)**
- **What it does:** Sets how fast Woggle CV "chases" the Stepped/Smooth voltages
- **CCW:** Woggle responds quickly to changes
- **CW:** Woggle responds slowly, creating unique decay shapes
- **Unique feature:** Creates "stepped voltages with decaying sinusoids" - exists nowhere else!
- **Musical result:** Pitch slides that are stepped but smooth, filter sweeps with organic character

### **4. Disturb Button (Manual Chaos Control)**
- **What it does:** Manual trigger for Sample & Hold circuit
- **Press momentarily:** Forces new random value immediately
- **Hold down:** Pauses randomness at current value
- **Performance use:** Real-time intervention in the chaos
- **Emergency function:** "Wake up" a Wogglebug that seems stuck in a pattern

## Understanding the Wogglebug Ecosystem

### **The Three CV Personalities:**
- **Stepped Output:** Classic sample & hold - discrete random voltages (0-10V)
- **Smooth Output:** Lagged version of Stepped - creates smooth curves between values (0-10V)
- **Woggle CV:** The signature Wogglebug invention - stepped with sinusoidal transitions (0-10V)

### **The Audio Voices of Chaos:**
- **Smooth VCO:** "Shark's fin" waveform controlled by all CV circuits (10Vpp audio)
- **Woggle VCO:** Square wave following the Woggle CV (10Vpp audio)
- **Ring-Mod Output:** Digital ring modulation of both VCOs + Influence input

### **Clock & Trigger Outputs:**
- **Clock Output:** Square wave from internal generator, continues even with external clock
- **Burst Output:** Random gates synchronized to clock - another flavor of uncertainty

### **Input Philosophy:**
- **Ego Input:** "Direct injection to the uncertain, beating heart" - biases all randomness
- **Influence Input:** Modulates VCO frequencies, feeds Ring-Mod, shifts Woggle CV
- **External Clock:** Overrides internal clock while keeping other functions independent
- **Speed/Chaos CV:** Normalled to +8V, extends range to ~200Hz when patched
