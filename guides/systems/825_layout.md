## Key Design Principles

### Hands-On Workflow Priority
- **Most interactive modules** placed in easily accessible rows (2, 4, 6)
- **MATHS** at left edge of Row 4 for easy access
- **MISO** at right edge of Row 4 for easy access  
- **Turing Machine + expanders** in Row 6 for hands-on control
- **MetaModule + Pressure Points** in Row 6 for performance

### Expander Relationships Maintained
- **arbhar + USB Expander + expander** (adjacent in Row 5)
- **MetaModule + MetaAIO + Wi-Fi Expander** (adjacent in Row 6)
- **QD + Qex** (adjacent and physically connected in Row 5)
- **Castor & Pollux II + expander** (adjacent in Row 5)
- **ochd + expander** (adjacent in Row 4)
- **Turing Machine + LPG Expander** (adjacent in Row 6)
- **Percussion Interface + Expander** (adjacent in Row 6)

### Signal Multiplication
- **Mult distribution across rows** for convenient signal splitting
- **Links modules** provide sophisticated mult/mixing capabilities
- **Buff Mult** for buffered splitting where needed

### Special Positioning
- **arbhar next to DATA** for hands-on granular control and monitoring
- **DATA at rightmost position** in Row 5 for easy viewing
- **Function Junction correctly categorized** as modulation hub (Row 4)

## Power Considerations
- All rows within power capacity limits
- Zone assignments flexible for MetaModule, arbhar, and other high-power modules
- No power violations across any row

## Total System
- **75 modules** across 6 rows
- **Workflow-optimized** for hands-on performance and patching
- **All expander relationships preserved**
- **Every row has signal multiplication capability**
