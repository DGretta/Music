## Quick Start: Get Your First MIDI Routing in 5 Minutes

**What is MRCC?** A front-panel configurable MIDI router that connects 12 inputs to 17 outputs with no computer required. Features USB host ports for modern devices, traditional 5-pin DIN for vintage gear, and comprehensive filtering and processing options.

### Your First Basic Routing
1. **Connect MIDI controller** → Any input port (USB host ports A-D or 5-pin inputs 1-6)
2. **Connect sound module** → Any output port (5-pin outputs 1-12 or USB PC port)
3. **Press input button** → Input LED lights green
4. **Press output button** → Output LED lights blue (route is made)
5. **Play your controller** → Sound module should respond

**Important:** MRCC routes MIDI data - you still need audio connections for sound!

## Beginner "Gotchas" & Pro Tips

### **⚠️ Common Mistakes:**

**"MIDI vs Audio confusion"**
- **MRCC routes MIDI data only** - you still need audio cables for sound!
- **Solution:** Connect MIDI for control, audio cables for sound to your interface/mixer

**"USB Host vs Device confusion"**
- **Host ports (A-D)** connect to keyboards, controllers (devices that need a computer)
- **Device port (PC)** connects to computers (the computer acts as host)
- **Solution:** Controllers → Host ports, Computers → Device port

**"Virtual cable mysteries"**
- **Each USB connection can carry multiple virtual MIDI cables**
- **DAW tracks can route to different virtual cables for individual hardware control**
- **Solution:** Set up virtual cable routing in your DAW for multi-device control

### **🎵 Pro Tips:**

**MRCC LED Language:**
- **Green LEDs = Active inputs** (receiving MIDI data)
- **Blue LEDs = Selected outputs** (routing destinations)
- **Yellow LEDs = Remote routing** (extended via CAT5 cable)
- **Activity monitoring:** LEDs show real-time MIDI flow for troubleshooting

**Routing Efficiency:**
- **One input can route to multiple outputs** simultaneously
- **Multiple inputs can route to same output** (automatic merging)
- **Route removal:** Press dimly lit output button twice to disconnect

**Professional Workflow:**
- **Label your ports** using MRCC's labeling system for complex studios
- **Use filtering** to prevent MIDI conflicts in large setups
- **Clock source hierarchy:** Establish one master clock source for timing

**Advanced Integration:**
- **Remote Y routing** extends capabilities to additional rooms
- **Program Change routing** enables scene changes across entire studio
- **Backup routing paths** provide professional reliability for critical applications
