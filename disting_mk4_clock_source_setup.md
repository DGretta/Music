# Disting mk4 Clock Source Setup Guide

## **Setting Up Disting mk4 as Clock Source**

### **Step 1: Select the Clock Algorithm**
1. **Press the S encoder once** to enter the menu
2. **Press S again** to select "Algorithm" (first menu item)
3. **Turn the S encoder** to navigate to algorithm **F.1 - Clock** (this is the main clock algorithm)
4. **Press S** to confirm selection

### **Step 2: Configure the Clock**
- **Z knob/CV**: Controls the clock rate/speed
- **Z button press**: Acts as **tap tempo** - press repeatedly to set the tempo
- **X input**: External clock input (if you want to sync to another clock)
- **Y input**: Run/stop control
- **A & B outputs**: Clock outputs (can be set to different divisions)

### **Step 3: Set Clock Divisions (if needed)**
- The clock algorithm allows you to set different divisions for outputs A and B
- **Turn the Z knob** while the algorithm is running to adjust parameters
- The display will show the current division settings

### **Alternative Clock Algorithms:**
- **F.2 - Clock Divider/Multiplier**: If you have an external clock and want divisions
- **B.5 - LFO**: Can also work as a slow clock source
- **C.3 - Euclidean Patterns**: For more complex rhythmic patterns

### **Basic Usage:**
1. **Patch output A or B** to your sequencer's clock input, envelope triggers, or other modules that need timing
2. **Adjust Z knob** to set desired tempo
3. **Press Z button** multiple times to tap in a tempo
4. **Use Y input** to start/stop the clock if needed

### **Notes:**
- The Disting will remember the last algorithm and settings when powered off
- Once set up as a clock source, it will return to that function when you power up the system
- The F.1 Clock algorithm is specifically designed for generating master clock signals
- You can use tap tempo to quickly sync to external music or set precise BPMs
