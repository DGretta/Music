## Conclusion

This phased 3U expansion strategy transforms your exceptional hardware collection into a unified creative instrument specifically optimized for KLF-inspired ambient house music. By focusing on sample manipulation, atmospheric processing, and smooth modulation sources, each phase delivers immediate creative benefits while building toward a comprehensive production environment.

The key insight remains: **eurorack enhances rather than replaces** your existing workflow. Your Digitakt, MPCs, and semi-modular synths remain the foundation - the eurorack system becomes the sophisticated processing and control layer that enables the dreamy, sample-heavy aesthetic you're pursuing.

**The eternal now of ambient house, now with precision modular control.**

*Next Phase: Begin with Nebulae v2 and Maths - the combination that will immediately unlock new creative possibilities with your existing samples and external gear.*
