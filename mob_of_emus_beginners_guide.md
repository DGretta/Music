---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Sound in 5 Minutes

**What is Mob of Emus?** A six-channel synthesis powerhouse that packs an enormous amount of creative power into just 16HP. Think of it as having six independent modules that can work together or separately - each channel can be an oscillator, LFO, envelope, rhythm pattern, noise source, quantizer, or modulation source.

### Your First Harmonic Stack
1. **Click Preset 1** - "Warp This" (audio oscillator stack)
2. **Patch Mix Output** → your VCA or filter input
3. **Turn Freq knob** - change the overall pitch of all six oscillators
4. **Hold Option + turn Variation/Warp knob** - hear the frequency warping effect!
5. **Hold Option + turn Harm#/Series knob** - try different harmonic relationships
6. **Turn H.Gain knob** - balance between fundamental and harmonic frequencies

### Discover Polyrhythmic Magic
1. **Click Preset 4** - "4/4 Drums with Variation"
2. **Patch Channel 1 Output** → kick drum trigger input
3. **Patch Channel 2 Output** → snare drum trigger input  
4. **Click Tap/Trig button repeatedly** at your desired tempo
5. **Turn Variation knob slightly** - add rhythmic complexity
6. **Turn Octave knob** to halve/double the tempo

## Essential Parameters (The Big 6)

### **1. FREQ/FINE/SEMI**
- **What it does:** Sets each channel's frequency (like pitch on an oscillator)
- **Range:** ±2 octaves from base frequency
- **Musical use:** Tune your oscillators, set LFO speeds, adjust rhythm timing
- **Option 1:** Fine tuning for precise detuning effects
- **Option 2:** Semitone steps for musical intervals

### **2. OCTAVE/2X**  
- **What it does:** Sets the octave range (audio vs modulation speeds)
- **Range:** ±5 octaves (±10 with Option 1)
- **Key concept:** This determines audio rate vs LFO rate
- **Sweet spots:** -2 to -4 for LFOs, +2 to +4 for audio oscillators

### **3. WAVE/ENV/PAT**
- **What it does:** Selects the waveform/pattern for each channel
- **Bank 1 (Primary):** Classic waves - sine, saw, square, triangle, S&H
- **Bank 2 (Option 1):** Envelopes - various ADSR shapes, smoothed random
- **Bank 3 (Option 2):** Rhythm patterns - kick, snare, hihat, clave patterns

### **4. HARM#/SERIES**
- **What it does:** Sets harmonic relationships between channels
- **Individual Mode:** Frequency multiplier (1-32x) for each channel
- **Hex Mode:** How many channels playing (1-6) + harmonic series presets
- **Magic moment:** This is what makes complex harmony and polyrhythms effortless!

### **5. H.GAIN/MIX**
- **What it does:** Individual channel levels + mix inclusion
- **Individual Mode:** Channel volume, Option 1 = include in mix output
- **Hex Mode:** "Harmonic gain" - balance between low/high numbered channels
- **Pro tip:** Turn CCW in Hex mode to emphasize fundamental frequencies

### **6. HEX Button & Mode**
- **What it does:** Control all 6 channels simultaneously as a macro layer
- **When lit:** All knob movements affect all channels at once
- **Key concept:** Your individual programming stays intact, Hex mode adds offsets
- **Game changer:** Create complex variations without losing your basic setup

## Understanding the Harmonic Concept

### **What Makes Mob of Emus Special:**
The "harmonic" control structure is what sets Mob of Emus apart from other multi-channel modules. Instead of just having six random oscillators, it uses **mathematical relationships** from music theory and acoustics to create naturally musical interactions.

### **Harmonic Series in Nature:**
- **Fundamental frequency** (1x) - the root note you hear
- **First harmonic** (2x) - one octave higher  
- **Second harmonic** (3x) - perfect fifth above that
- **Third harmonic** (4x) - two octaves higher
- And so on... these are the **natural overtones** present in acoustic instruments

### **Mob of Emus' Innovation:**
- **Each channel** can be set to any harmonic number (1-32x)
- **Instant harmonic series** via preset combinations
- **Polyrhythmic applications** - same math works for rhythm (1=whole note, 2=half note, 4=quarter note)
- **Hex Mode control** - conductor layer that maintains relationships while adding variation

### **The 15 Harmonic Series Presets:**
1. **Unison** {1,1,1,1,1,1} - All channels same frequency
2. **All** {1,2,3,4,5,6} - Natural harmonic series
3. **Powers of 2** {1,2,4,8,16,32} - Perfect for 4/4 rhythms
4. **12/8 Rhythm** {1,2,4,6,8,12} - Compound time signatures
5. **3/4 Rhythm** {1,2,3,4,6,8} - Waltz and triple meter
6. **3+5 Rhythm** {1,2,3,5,6,10} - Complex polyrhythms
7. **Odd** {1,3,5,7,9,11} - Hollow, clarinet-like timbres
8. **Fave Odd** {1,5,9,11,15,19} - Composer's favorite odd harmonics
9. **Fibonacci** {1,2,3,5,8,13} - Mathematical beauty in music

### **Why This Matters:**
Instead of randomly setting six channels, you can instantly access **thousands of years** of musical knowledge about what frequency relationships sound good together!

## Beginner Patch Ideas

### **Patch 1: Rich Additive Synthesis**
- **Load Preset 7** - "Additive Oscillator"
- **Patch Mix Output** → filter → VCA
- **LFO** → **H.Gain CV input** (rhythmic harmonic intensity)
- **Envelope** → **Full CV frequency input**
- **Experiment with:** Different harmonic series (Option 1 on HARM#/SERIES)
- **Result:** Classic additive synthesis with easy harmonic control

### **Patch 2: Polyrhythmic Modulation Bank**
- **All channels to LFO rate** (Octave at -3)
- **Set harmonic series** to "Powers of 2" 
- **Patch individual outputs** → multiple VCA CV inputs
- **Sync with Tap/Trig** button for tempo
- **Turn Variation slightly** for rhythmic interest
- **Result:** Six related but different LFO rates creating polyrhythmic modulation

### **Patch 3: Six-Channel Quantized Arpeggiator**
- **CV Input Mode:** QUANT (double-click hold Option + Preset 6)
- **External CV sources** → all 6 CV inputs
- **Set different scales** for each channel (Quant parameter)
- **Individual outputs** → different oscillator pitch inputs
- **Mix output** → master melody line
- **Result:** Six-channel quantizer with different scales simultaneously

## Beginner "Gotchas" & Pro Tips

### **⚠️ Common Mistakes:**

**"I'm not hearing anything from the mix output!"**
- Check that channels are included in the mix (Option 1 on H.GAIN/MIX)
- **Solution:** Select channel, hold Option, turn H.Gain/Mix knob clockwise from center

**"My knobs don't seem to match what I'm hearing!"**
- When loading presets, knob positions don't match saved values
- **Solution:** This is normal - parameter only changes when you actually move the knob

**"In Individual mode, turning knobs does nothing!"**
- No channels are selected for editing
- **Solution:** Click Channel Selector buttons to select channels (LED chase alerts you to this)

**"The CV inputs aren't working!"**
- Wrong CV Input Mode selected for your application
- **Solution:** Double-click hold Option + click Preset button to select correct mode

### **🎵 Pro Tips:**

**Starting Strategy:**
- **Begin with Preset 2** ("Saw Swarm") to understand basic oscillator stacking
- **Experiment with harmonic series** before trying individual programming
- **Use Hex Mode first** to understand overall behavior, then dive into individuals

**Harmonic Programming:**
- **Start all channels same frequency** then add harmonic numbers for relationships
- **Low harmonic numbers (1-8)** for musical timbres
- **Odd harmonics only** for hollow, woody sounds  
- **Even harmonics** for brassy, rich sounds

**CV Input Mode Selection:**
- **MULTI + Hex Mode:** One CV controls same parameter on all channels
- **FREQ Mode:** Individual oscillator control for polyrhythms
- **TRIG Mode:** Perfect drum machine with individual channel control
- **QUANT Mode:** Six-channel external quantizer

**Performance Techniques:**
- **Tap/Trig button** for tempo setting instead of manual frequency adjustment
- **H.Gain in Hex Mode** for real-time harmonic balance control
- **Variation control** for adding subtle complexity to static patterns
- **Mode combinations:** Audio rate + LFO rate channels simultaneously

**Warp Function Sweet Spots:**
