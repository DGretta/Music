### Oscillator Section - The Sound Source:
- **4 identical analog VCOs** - Each with octave selection (16', 8', 4', 2') and four waveforms
- **Waveforms:** Triangle (pure), Sawtooth (harmonically rich), Square (hollow), Narrow Pulse (nasal)
- **FREQUENCY knobs (OSC 2-4):** Detune from OSC 1 by ±7 semitones (musical fifth range)
- **SYNC buttons:** Hard sync OSC 2→1, OSC 3→2, OSC 4→3 for metallic, harmonically complex tones
- **Key concept:** *When you turn FREQUENCY on a sync'd oscillator, the pitch stays locked but harmonic content changes dramatically*

### Mixer Section - Blending Sources:
- **Individual level controls** for each oscillator plus noise generator
- **External input** - Process external instruments through Matriarch's filters and effects
- **Overdrive at 11 o'clock+** - Analog distortion for aggressive tones
- **Key concept:** *Higher levels = more harmonics and analog saturation*

### Filter Section - Tone Shaping:
- **Dual Moog Ladder Filters** with three routing modes:
  - **HP/LP SERIES:** VCF1 (high pass) → VCF2 (low pass) = band pass response
  - **LP/LP STEREO:** Independent low pass filters for true stereo imaging
  - **HP/LP PARALLEL:** Both filters in parallel = notch filter response
- **CUTOFF:** Master cutoff frequency for both filters
- **SPACING:** Offset VCF1 frequency above/below VCF2
- **RESONANCE 1 & 2:** Independent resonance control (self-oscillation at 3 o'clock+)
- **Key concept:** *SPACING creates movement between the two filters even with static CUTOFF*

### Envelope Generators - Time-Based Changes:
- **Filter EG:** Controls filter cutoff frequency over time
- **Amplitude EG:** Controls output volume over time  
- **ADSR parameters:** Attack (rise time), Decay (fall time), Sustain (held level), Release (fade time)
- **ENVELOPE AMT:** How much the Filter EG affects cutoff (bipolar - negative inverts the envelope)
- **Key concept:** *Negative ENVELOPE AMT makes the filter close during attack instead of open*

### Modulation - Adding Movement:
- **LFO RATE:** Speed of modulation oscillator (.07 Hz to 1.3 kHz)
- **WAVEFORMS:** Sine, Sawtooth, Ramp, Square, Staircase, Smooth Random
- **MOD wheel amounts:** PITCH AMT, CUTOFF AMT, PULSE WIDTH AMT
- **Key concept:** *Set maximum amounts with knobs, then use MOD wheel for real-time control*

## Patch Examples

### Patch 1 (Basic): Classic Analog Bass

**Main Example:** Moog-style analog bass
```
Signal: OSC 1 (Square) → Filter (Low Pass) → VCA

Settings:
• OSC 1: 8', Square wave
• OSC 2: 8', Sawtooth, FREQUENCY -7 (octave down)
• MIXER: OSC 1 = 1 o'clock, OSC 2 = 10 o'clock
• FILTER: HP/LP SERIES mode, Cutoff = 9 o'clock, Resonance 1 = 12 o'clock
• ENVELOPE AMT: 3 o'clock (strong filter movement)
• Filter EG: A=fast, D=1 o'clock, S=zero, R=fast
• Amp EG: A=fast, D=medium, S=full, R=medium
```

**Playing technique:** Short, punchy notes. The filter envelope creates the classic "pluck" attack.

**Similar Synthesizer Options:**
- **Budget:** Behringer Model D, Korg Volca Bass
- **Different character:** Roland TB-303 (acid bass), Novation Bass Station II (modern digital)
- **Premium:** Moog Subsequent 37, Sequential Pro-3

### Patch 2 (Intermediate): Evolving Pad with Dual Oscillators

**Main Example:** Warm analog pad with movement
```
Signal: OSC 1 + OSC 3 (detuned) → Dual Filters → Stereo VCAs

Settings:
• OSC 1: 8', Sawtooth
• OSC 3: 8', Sawtooth, FREQUENCY +3 (minor third up)
• MIXER: OSC 1 = 12 o'clock, OSC 3 = 11 o'clock
• FILTER: LP/LP STEREO mode, Cutoff = 11 o'clock, Spacing = slight +
• RESONANCE 1 = 9 o'clock, RESONANCE 2 = 10 o'clock (different resonance per filter)
• ENVELOPE AMT: 1 o'clock (gentle filter movement)
• Filter EG: A=slow, D=slow, S=half, R=slow
• Amp EG: A=slow, D=medium, S=full, R=slow
• MODULATION: Rate = slow, Sine wave, CUTOFF AMT = 10 o'clock, raise MOD wheel slightly
```

**Playing technique:** Hold chords, let the slow envelopes and LFO create evolving textures.

- **Budget:** Korg Minilogue XD, Arturia PolyBrute 6
- **Different character:** Roland Jupiter-X (vintage digital), Novation Peak (wavetable hybrid)
- **Premium:** Sequential Prophet Rev2, Moog One

### Patch 3 (Advanced): Hard Sync Lead with Performance Control

**Main Example:** Aggressive sync lead with expressive control
```
Signal: OSC 1 + OSC 2 (hard sync'd) → Series Filters → Performance modulation

Settings:
• SYNC ENABLE: On (red button lit)
• OSC 1: 8', Sawtooth (sync master)
• OSC 2: 8', Square, FREQUENCY +2, 2→1 SYNC button On (sync'd to OSC 1)
• MIXER: OSC 1 = 11 o'clock, OSC 2 = 2 o'clock (sync oscillator louder)
• FILTER: HP/LP SERIES mode, Cutoff = 10 o'clock, Spacing = 0, Resonance 1 = 2 o'clock
• ENVELOPE AMT: 2 o'clock
• Filter EG: A=fast, D=2 o'clock, S=quarter, R=medium
• Amp EG: A=fast, D=medium, S=full, R=short
• MODULATION: Rate = medium, Square wave, PITCH MOD ASSIGN = 2&4, PITCH AMT = 11 o'clock
```

**Performance technique:** 
- Use MOD wheel to add pitch vibrato to OSC 2 & 4 only (creates sync harmonics without losing fundamental)
- Use aftertouch (if connected via rear panel) for filter expression
- GLIDE knob adds smooth pitch transitions between notes

**Similar Synthesizer Options:**
- **Budget:** Arturia MicroBrute (single osc sync), Korg MS-20 Mini 
- **Different character:** Make Noise 0-Coast (complex oscillator), Novation Peak (digital sync algorithms)
- **Premium:** Moog Matriarch (you're here!), Sequential Prophet Rev2

### Patch 4 (Expert): Paraphonic Chord Machine with Stereo Filtering

**Main Example:** 4-voice paraphonic chords with independent filter processing
```
Signal: 4 Oscillators (paraphonic) → Stereo Filters → Stereo VCAs → Stereo Delay

Settings:
• VOICE MODE: 4 (four-note paraphonic)
• MULTI TRIG: On (each new note retriggers envelopes)
• OSC 1-4: All 8', mix of Sawtooth and Square waves
• OSC 2 FREQUENCY: +4, OSC 3 FREQUENCY: +7, OSC 4 FREQUENCY: +3 (chord voicing)
• MIXER: All oscillators around 11-12 o'clock
• FILTER: LP/LP STEREO mode, Cutoff = 11 o'clock, Spacing = +3 (VCF1 brighter)
• RESONANCE 1 = 10 o'clock, RESONANCE 2 = 12 o'clock
• VCA MODE: SPLIT (Filter EG → VCA 1, Amp EG → VCA 2)
• Filter EG: A=medium, D=slow, S=half, R=medium
• Amp EG: A=fast, D=medium, S=full, R=long
• DELAY: Time = quarter note, Spacing = slight offset, Feedback = 1 o'clock, Mix = 10 o'clock
• MODULATION: Slow rate, Sine wave, CUTOFF AMT = 9 o'clock, slight MOD wheel
```

**Performance technique:**
- Play 3-4 note chords - each key triggers a separate oscillator
- Left channel (VCA 1) has filter envelope movement, right channel (VCA 2) is steady
- Stereo delay creates spacious, evolving textures
- Use HOLD button to latch chords while playing lead lines over them

**Similar Synthesizer Options:**
- **Budget:** None really - paraphonic with 4 oscillators + dual filters is unique to Matriarch
- **Different character:** Dave Smith Evolver (digital/analog hybrid paraphonic), Make Noise 0-Coast + Strega (modular paraphonic)
- **Premium:** Moog One (true polyphonic), Sequential Prophet X (sampling polyphonic)

- **Envelope generators** - Sustain level must be above zero for held notes
- **Oscillator levels** - At least one oscillator in MIXER section must be turned up
- **Filter cutoff** - If too low in low pass mode, all frequencies are filtered out

### Tuning Problems:
- **Warm-up time** - Allow 10-15 minutes for oscillator tuning stability (25 minutes if cold)
- **FINE TUNE** - Global tuning adjustment on rear panel (±1 semitone range)
- **Oscillator drift** - Normal for analog oscillators, especially during temperature changes
- **MIDI pitch bend** - Check pitch bend range in Global Settings (default: 2 semitones)

### MIDI Issues:
- **MIDI LED** - Should blink on rear panel when receiving MIDI data
