### Core Oscillator Controls:

#### **OCTAVE Selection (All Oscillators):**
- **16' (Sub-audio):** One octave below normal pitch, massive bass foundation
- **8' (Standard):** Normal keyboard pitch, most musical applications
- **4' (Octave up):** One octave above keyboard, brightness and harmonic content
- **2' (Two octaves up):** Very high pitch, harmonic reinforcement and sparkle
- **Key concept:** *Use different octaves across oscillators for instant chord structures*

#### **WAVEFORM Selection (All Oscillators):**
- **Triangle:** Pure fundamental, minimal harmonics, smooth pad foundations
- **Sawtooth:** Full harmonic series, bright and cutting, classic analog character
- **Square:** Odd harmonics only, hollow sound, perfect for sync and PWM
- **Narrow Pulse:** Very narrow duty cycle, nasal tone, excellent harmonic reinforcement
- **Key concept:** *Different waveforms across oscillators create complex harmonic interactions*

#### **FREQUENCY Knobs (OSC 2, 3, 4):**
- **Range:** ±7 semitones from OSC 1 (perfect fifth interval)
- **Center position:** Unison with OSC 1
- **Clockwise:** Higher pitch, creates ascending intervals
- **Counterclockwise:** Lower pitch, creates descending intervals
- **Key concept:** *Small detunes (±1-3) create chorus, larger intervals (±5-7) create chords*

### Hard Sync System:

#### **SYNC ENABLE (Master Control):**
- **Red button must be ON** for any sync operations to function
- **Global enable/disable** for entire sync system
- **Visual feedback:** Button lights when sync system is active

#### **Individual Sync Buttons:**
- **2←1 SYNC:** OSC 2 sync'd to OSC 1 (OSC 1 resets OSC 2's waveform cycle)
- **3←2 SYNC:** OSC 3 sync'd to OSC 2 (OSC 2 resets OSC 3's waveform cycle)  
- **4←3 SYNC:** OSC 4 sync'd to OSC 3 (OSC 3 resets OSC 4's waveform cycle)
- **Key concept:** *Sync'd oscillator's pitch stays locked to master, but harmonic content changes with FREQUENCY knob*

#### **Sync Behavior Deep Dive:**
```
Normal Oscillator:     ___/\___/\___/\___/\___
                       
Sync'd Oscillator:     ___/\|__/\|__/\|__/\|__
                           ↑     ↑     ↑     ↑
                        Reset  Reset Reset Reset
                      (from master oscillator)
```
When sync'd oscillator frequency is **higher** than master: Rich harmonic content, metallic tones
When sync'd oscillator frequency is **lower** than master: Incomplete cycles, filtered effect

### Linear FM (Frequency Modulation):
- **LIN FM IN patch points** on each oscillator
- **AC-coupled inputs** for audio-rate modulation
- **Creates inharmonic sidebands** unlike analog sync
- **Perfect for:** Bell tones, metallic percussion, complex harmonic structures
- **Key concept:** *Use one oscillator's audio output to modulate another's frequency for FM synthesis*

## Patch Examples

### Patch 1 (Basic): Single Oscillator Character Study

**Main Example:** Understanding individual oscillator personalities
```

Study Sequence:
1. OSC 1 only: 8', Sawtooth, Mixer level 12 o'clock
2. Switch to Triangle - hear the fundamental purity
3. Switch to Square - hear the hollow, odd-harmonic character  
4. Switch to Narrow Pulse - hear the nasal, harmonic-rich tone
5. Try different octaves: 16' (massive), 4' (bright), 2' (sparkle)

Filter Settings:
• HP/LP SERIES mode, Cutoff = 11 o'clock, Resonance 1 = 9 o'clock
• ENVELOPE AMT = 1 o'clock (gentle filter movement)
• Filter EG: A=fast, D=medium, S=half, R=medium
```

**Learning objective:** Understand how each waveform contributes different harmonic content and character.

## Historical Context

The concept of multiple analog oscillators in a single instrument traces back to the earliest modular synthesizers of the 1960s. Bob Moog's original modular systems allowed musicians to combine multiple VCOs for harmonic complexity, a tradition continued in the Matriarch's four-oscillator architecture.

**Oscillator Sync Innovation:** Hard oscillator sync was pioneered in the 1970s and became a signature sound of aggressive analog synthesis. The Matriarch's implementation allows cascading sync relationships (OSC 1→2→3→4) for unprecedented harmonic complexity.

**Linear FM Heritage:** While FM synthesis is often associated with digital instruments, linear FM between analog oscillators creates different harmonic characteristics. The Matriarch's analog FM capabilities bridge classic analog synthesis with more complex harmonic generation techniques.

**Educational Significance:** Four independent oscillators provide an ideal platform for understanding fundamental synthesis concepts - harmonic series, frequency relationships, modulation techniques, and complex signal interaction - making the Matriarch an excellent synthesis learning instrument.
