2. **Turn Tune knob** to around 12 o'clock (C4 range)
3. **Press the button** until LED shows **YELLOW** (Chord algorithm)
4. **Turn PAR1** (left knob) to select chord type (major, minor, 7th, etc.)
5. **Patch 1V/Oct from your sequencer** ‚Üí **1V/Oct input**
6. **Patch output** ‚Üí your mixer/VCA
7. **Play notes** - you should hear rich chords!

**Quick Algorithm Tour:**
- **Press button repeatedly** to cycle through 8 algorithms

## Beginner "Gotchas" & Pro Tips

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:**

**"My Karplus Strong doesn't make sound!"**
- Karplus Strong REQUIRES gate/trigger input to initiate the string
- **Solution:** Patch a gate/trigger signal to the Gate input

**"The pitch tracking seems off in the low end!"**
- Pico Voice tracks C1-C8, below 1V it doesn't track properly
- **Solution:** Stay within the C1-C8 range (1V-8V)

**"I can't get sustained sounds!"**
- Some algorithms depend on gate length for sustain
- **Solution:** Turn PAR2 fully clockwise for sustained operation without gates

### **üéµ Pro Tips:**

**Algorithm Workflow:**
- **Learn the LED colors** - much faster than counting button presses
- **Start with Chords or PWM** - most immediately musical
- **Experiment with configuration settings** - they dramatically change character

**CV Assignment Strategy:**
- **Assign CV to PAR1** for most dramatic changes
- **Assign to Tune** for pitch modulation and vibrato
- **Assign to PAR2** for expression and dynamics
- **Change assignments per algorithm** for complex patches

**Performance Techniques:**
- **Algorithm switching** creates instant texture changes
- **Parameter automation** via CV for evolving sounds
- **Configuration mode** allows real-time sound design
- **Gate pattern variations** especially important for Karplus Strong

**Sound Design Tips:**
- **Wavetable + slow LFO** = evolving pads
- **Bassline + envelope** = classic acid
- **Supersaw + detune** = massive leads
- **Wavefold + modulation** = complex harmonics
