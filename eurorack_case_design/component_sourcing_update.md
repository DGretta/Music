## Component Sourcing Breakthroughs - September 25, 2025

### **Power Supply Decision - FINALIZED**
- **Trogotronic m/15 6U** selected at $325 per unit
- **10A capacity, 60 power ports** per unit  
- **Two units per case** (one for horizontal sections, one for vertical sections)
- **Domestic shipping** eliminates international logistics complications
- **Quick availability** supports project timeline requirements

### **Rail Sourcing Solution - DRAMATIC COST REDUCTION**
- **Eurorackhardware.com** custom-cut rails at **$0.35/HP per pair**
- **Total rail cost:** $647 for two-case system vs. $1,800+ from other suppliers
- **Custom 84HP lengths** - exact fit for case requirements
- **Includes mounting screws** - complete solution
- **Cost reduction:** 65% savings over Synthrotek/TipTop pricing

**Rail Requirements:**
- **Per case:** 9 rail pairs (7×3U + 2×1U sections)
- **Two-case triptych:** 18 rail pairs total (1,848HP capacity)
- **Three-case triptych:** 27 rail pairs total (2,772HP capacity)

### **Rejected Options - Lessons Learned**

**Konstant Lab HammerPWR:** Eliminated due to international shipping complexity and higher cost (~$540 vs $325)

**Vector TS600 Rails:** Eliminated due to weight (2kg per 5-foot section creates structural problems)

**Synthrotek/TipTop Rails:** Eliminated due to pricing ($45-50 per rail vs $0.35/HP)

### **Project Feasibility Impact**
- **Budget improvement:** $1,153-1,730 in cost savings on major components
- **Supply chain risk reduction:** Domestic suppliers for both power and rails
- **Project viability:** Major components now cost ~$1,300-1,945 vs. previous estimates >$3,000

## Option A vs. Option B Reality Assessment

### **Option A: Custom Triptych**
- **Scope:** Multi-year furniture fabrication project
- **Capacity:** 252-378HP depending on case count
- **Resource requirement:** Substantial but bounded

### **Option B: Wall Installation**  
- **Scope:** 6+ months R&D + systems engineering megaproject
- **Capacity:** 1,000-2,000HP+ architectural integration
- **Resource requirement:** Complete life reorganization

### **Resource Constraint Reality**
"I cannot do both, right now. There is no path forward for that much work."

**Time mathematics:** No amount of enthusiasm creates additional 50-100 hours per day
**Decision framework:** Creative ambition vs. available capacity - want exceeds feasibility

## Knowledge Preservation Strategy

### **Stewardship Recognition**
- **Personal sharing:** Direct connections through studio collaboration
- **Public documentation:** GitHub repositories for technical methodologies  
- **Enhanced documentation:** Considering video + text approaches for wider accessibility
- **Permanence hierarchy:** Stone/marble > paper > digital for critical knowledge

### **Archaeological Mischief (Thought Exercise)**
- **Custom fonts** and **obfuscated engraving** for desert stone documentation
- **Closing line concept:** "I am not saying it was aliens..."
- **Implementation reality:** Interesting conceptually but resource-intensive vs. practical documentation

## Teaching and Culture Change Methodology

### **Universal Teaching Approach**
"Teach MBAs like children" - proven methodology across contexts:
- **Question interruptions** signal shift from defensive to engaged learning
- **"Embarrassed acolyte to graceful master"** progression through humility
- **Systematic repetition** and **safe learning environment**

### **Organizational Culture Challenge**
**Target phrase:** "That's a problem for future me"
**Cultural toxicity:** Creates technical debt and knowledge loss
**Alternative framework:** "Future me IS me - same standards, same responsibility"
**Implementation strategy:** Target recent acquisitions for isolated testing
