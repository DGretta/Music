## Quick Start: Your First Subharmonic Chord in 10 Minutes

**What is the Subharmonicon?** The Subharmonicon is Moog's most conceptually advanced semi-modular synthesizer, combining subharmonic oscillators with polyrhythmic sequencing. Based on historic instruments like the Mixtur-Trautonium and Rhythmicon, it uses mathematical integer relationships to create both harmonic intervals and rhythmic patterns that are inherently musical and coherent.

### Your First Mathematical Music Pattern

1. **Power Connection** - Connect the included 12V power adapter to the rear panel jack. The unit powers on immediately (no power switch).

2. **Audio Output** - With VOLUME fully counterclockwise, connect a 1/4" TS cable from AUDIO OUT to your amp, interface, or headphones.

3. **Basic Subharmonic Settings:**
   ```
   VCO 1 FREQUENCY: 12 o'clock (fundamental pitch)
   VCO 1 WAVE: Square (harmonically rich)
   VCO 1 LEVEL: 2 o'clock (prominent fundamental)
   
   SUB 1 FREQ: 10 o'clock (f/2 - octave below)
   SUB 1 LEVEL: 1 o'clock (strong harmonic)
   
   SUB 2 FREQ: 8 o'clock (f/3 - perfect fifth below octave)
   SUB 2 LEVEL: 11 o'clock (present but balanced)
   
   VCO 2 FREQUENCY: 1 o'clock (slightly higher fundamental)
   VCO 2 WAVE: Square (matching harmonic content)
   VCO 2 LEVEL: 1 o'clock (secondary voice)
   
   VCF CUTOFF: 2 o'clock (open and bright)
   VCF RESONANCE: 10 o'clock (slight emphasis)
   VCF EG AMOUNT: 11 o'clock (filter movement)
   
   VCA EG AMOUNT: 2 o'clock (pronounced envelope)
   VOLUME: 9 o'clock (start low!)
   
   VCO DECAY: 1 o'clock (sustained notes)
   VCF DECAY: 11 o'clock (filter movement)
   
   TEMPO: 11 o'clock (moderate tempo)
   ```

4. **Set Up Your First Sequencer:**
   - Press **OSC 1** button (under SEQ 1 ASSIGN) so it's lit
   - Press **SUB 1** button (under SEQ 1 ASSIGN) so it's lit  
   - Press **SUB 2** button (under SEQ 1 ASSIGN) so it's lit
   - Press **SEQ OCT** to select **±2** range
   - Press **SEQ 1** button (under RHYTHM 1) so it's lit

5. **Program a Simple Sequence:**
   - Set **RHYTHM 1** to position 4 (quarter note divisions)
   - Adjust the STEP knobs:
     ```
     STEP 1: 12 o'clock (root note)
     STEP 2: 2 o'clock (higher pitch)
     STEP 3: 10 o'clock (lower pitch)  
     STEP 4: 12 o'clock (return to root)
     ```

6. **Start Your Pattern:**
   - Press **EG** button so it's lit (enables envelope triggering)
   - Press **PLAY** button to start the sequence
   - Gradually increase **VOLUME** to taste

7. **Add Polyrhythm:**
   - Press **SEQ 1** button under RHYTHM 2 (now both rhythm generators drive sequencer 1)
   - Set **RHYTHM 2** to position 6 (creates 4-against-6 polyrhythm)
   - Listen as the mathematical relationship creates a complex, evolving pattern

**Congratulations!** You've just created your first subharmonic chord progression with polyrhythmic timing - pure mathematical music!

## Why the Subharmonicon Excels

### **Unique Musical Strengths:**

- **Mathematical Harmony Foundation:** Unlike traditional synthesis that relies on arbitrary frequency relationships, Subharmonicon uses precise integer ratios (f/2, f/3, f/4, etc.) that create naturally consonant harmonic intervals. These subharmonic relationships are mathematically perfect and inherently musical.

- **Six-Oscillator Architecture:** Each of the two main VCOs spawns two additional subharmonic oscillators, creating a total of six voices from two controls. This enables rich chord structures and complex harmonic textures impossible with traditional synthesizers.

- **Algorithmic Polyrhythm Generation:** The four rhythm generators use integer division (1-16) of the master tempo to create mathematically related polyrhythms. These patterns interweave in predictable yet complex ways, eventually synchronizing to create larger cyclic structures.

### **Technical Advantages:**

- **Coherent Musical Relationships:** Both harmonic (pitch) and rhythmic (timing) elements use the same mathematical foundation - integer ratios. This creates music where every element relates to every other element in mathematically perfect ways.

- **Historic Electronic Music Concepts:** Based on pioneering instruments like Oskar Sala's Mixtur-Trautonium and the Schillinger-Cowell-Theremin Rhythmicon, bringing 1930s electronic music innovation to modern semi-modular format.

- **Intelligent Complexity:** Despite sophisticated mathematical underpinnings, the interface remains intuitive. Turn knobs to explore harmonic and rhythmic relationships without needing to understand the mathematics.

### **Creative Potential:**

- **Algorithmic Composition Tool:** Creates musical structures that would be difficult or impossible to program manually. The mathematical relationships ensure that even random knob movements produce musically coherent results.

- **Generative Music Creation:** Set up initial conditions and let the polyrhythm generators create evolving, self-developing musical phrases. Perfect for ambient music, algorithmic composition, and experimental electronic music.

- **Harmonic Exploration:** Discover interval relationships and chord structures that exist in nature but are rarely used in Western music. Opens new territories for harmonic exploration and composition.

### **Signal Flow Understanding:**

**Sound Generation Chain:**
1. **VCO 1** generates fundamental frequency with three waveforms (Saw/PWM/Square)
2. **SUB 1** creates first subharmonic (f/2, f/3, f/4, etc.) based on VCO 1
3. **SUB 2** creates second subharmonic with independent frequency division
4. **VCO 2** provides second fundamental frequency with same waveform options
5. **SUB 3 & SUB 4** create subharmonics based on VCO 2
6. **All six oscillators** mix together before filtering

**Sequencing and Rhythm Integration:**
- **Rhythm Generators 1-4** create clock divisions (1-16) from master tempo
- **Sequencer 1** can be driven by any combination of Rhythm Generators 1&2
- **Sequencer 2** can be driven by any combination of Rhythm Generators 3&4
- **Assignment Matrix** routes sequencer outputs to any combination of oscillators
- **Polyrhythms** emerge when multiple rhythm generators drive the same sequencer

**Mathematical Relationships:**
- **Subharmonic Frequencies:** f/1, f/2, f/3, f/4, f/5, f/6, f/7, f/8, f/9, f/10, f/11, f/12, f/13, f/14, f/15, f/16
- **Rhythm Divisions:** Same integer ratios applied to time instead of frequency
- **Natural Coherence:** Mathematical relationships ensure all elements work together harmonically and rhythmically
