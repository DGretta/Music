## Beginner "Gotchas" & Pro Tips

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:**

**"My patch cables aren't working!"**
- **Taiga's internal routing is always active** until you override it with patch cables
- **Solution:** Patching an output breaks its internal connection - this is a feature, not a bug

**"I can't hear anything when I patch cables"**
- **Signal levels matter** - some outputs are hot, others need amplification
- **Solution:** Use the preamp module or check your patch cable routing

**"The filter isn't doing anything"**
- **Filter frequency might be fully open** or the resonance settings might be extreme
- **Solution:** Start with frequency at 12 o'clock, resonance low, then adjust to taste

**"MIDI isn't working properly"**
- **Check MIDI channel and velocity settings** in the control module
- **Solution:** Start with OMNI mode, then configure specific channels as needed

### **üéµ Pro Tips:**

**Patchbay Mastery:**
- **Green jacks = inputs, white jacks = outputs** - Taiga's color coding makes patching intuitive
- **Start simple** and build complexity gradually - don't try to patch everything at once
- **Document successful patches** with photos or notes for later recall

**Signal Flow Optimization:**
- **Use the preamp strategically** - it can add warmth and drive to any signal
- **Dynamics module is unique** - experiment with VCA, low-pass gate, and pluck modes
- **Analog delay adds character** - even short delay times create analog warmth

**Performance Techniques:**
- **Arpeggiator and sequencer** are powerful for live performance - learn the edit mode functions
- **Multiple oscillator sync** creates rich, evolving timbres perfect for leads and basses
- **Filter self-oscillation** can serve as an additional oscillator when needed
