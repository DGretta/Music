# SOMA Pulsar-23 - Complete Guide
*Organismic Drum Machine with 23 Modules of Analog Chaos*

---

## Quick Start: Create Your First Rhythmic Pattern in 10 Minutes

**What is Pulsar-23?** An organismic drum machine where 23 analog modules work together as a living system - four unique sound generators, four looper-recorders, chaos generators, and effects all interconnected through SOMA's revolutionary "everything can interact with everything" design philosophy.

### Your First Organismic Pattern
1. **Power on** - the Pulsar immediately starts generating internal clock signals
2. **Touch the first sensor strip** (front edge, leftmost when lying flat) - you'll hear the bass drum generator
3. **Press LOOPER 1 REC** and tap the sensor rhythmically for 4-8 beats
4. **Press LOOPER 1 REC again** to close the loop - your rhythm now plays automatically
5. **Touch other sensor strips** to explore kick, snare, hi-hat, and bass synth sounds
6. **Press additional LOOPER REC buttons** while playing to layer multiple rhythm elements
7. **Adjust the four LEVEL knobs** to balance your rhythmic pattern

**Congratulations!** You've just created a living, breathing rhythmic pattern using SOMA's organismic approach - where touch-sensitive controls and looper-recorders work together to capture and evolve your musical gestures!

## Essential Interface (The Pulsar-23 Organismic Architecture)

### **23 Main Modules + 13 Auxiliary Units:**
- **4 Sound Generators:** Bass drum, kick, snare, hi-hat (each with completely different synthesis architectures)
- **4 Looper-Recorders:** Capture and replay rhythmic patterns with CV control
- **Clock Generator + Dividers:** Master timing with multiple subdivisions
- **Controlled Chaos Generator:** Organic randomness for evolving patterns
- **LFO + Sample & Hold:** Modulation sources that can also serve as sound generators
- **2-Channel CV Effects Processor:** Process internal or external audio
- **Distortion + 2 Controlled Amplifiers:** Signal shaping and dynamics
- **Envelope Generators:** 4 flexible envelope generators with sustain recognition
- **Utilities:** Inverter, controlled inverter, analog switches, noise generator, attenuators

### **SOMA's Organismic Principles in Action:**
- **Everything Can Interact:** Any output can connect to any input via alligator clips
- **Blurred Functions:** Bass drum can serve as LFO, LFO can be audio source, effects can modulate generators
- **Non-Linear Structure:** No fixed signal path - any module can lead or follow
- **Dynamic Equilibrium:** System behavior emerges from module interactions
- **Sustain Recognition:** Touch duration affects sound character (percussion vs. sustained tones)

### **Three Simultaneous Control Modes:**
- **Stand-Alone:** Touch sensors, internal sequencing, organismic self-modulation
- **MIDI Control:** Full MIDI integration with 4-channel MIDI-to-CV conversion
- **CV Control:** Eurorack-compatible inputs/outputs for modular system integration
- **All modes work simultaneously** in any combination

### **Alligator Clip Connection System:**
- **Over 90 connection points** throughout the instrument
- **No "wrong" connections** - everything is protected and musically useful
- **Color coding:** Input/output identification for intuitive patching
- **Auto-mixing:** Multiple signals connected together mix automatically
- **Bidirectional points:** Envelope triggers auto-detect input vs. output needs

## Beginner "Gotchas" & Pro Tips

### **⚠️ Common Mistakes:**

**"My alligator clips aren't working!"**
- **All connections are protected** from -20V to +20V, so nothing will break
- **Solution:** Experiment freely - SOMA designed the system for fearless exploration without damage

**"The patterns sound too chaotic and unpredictable"**
- **Organismic behavior can be overwhelming initially** when everything modulates everything
- **Solution:** Start simple with single layers, gradually add complexity and modulation

**"I can't get tight, precise rhythms"**
- **Touch sensors are pressure and duration sensitive** - they respond to human expression
- **Solution:** Use MIDI input for precise timing, touch sensors for expressive performance

**"The body conductivity patches don't seem to work"**
- **Skin conductivity varies with moisture, temperature, and contact area**
- **Solution:** Slightly damp fingers, firm contact, experiment with different body parts

### **🎵 Pro Tips:**

**Organismic Workflow Mastery:**
- **Start with one looper** and build layers gradually - let patterns evolve organically over time
- **Use chaos sparingly** - a little controlled randomness goes a long way in creating living patterns
- **Combine touch sensitivity with MIDI** for both expressive and precise elements in the same pattern

**Advanced Patching Techniques:**
- **Audio to CV conversion** - use audio outputs as modulation sources for true organismic behavior
- **Feedback loop design** - create stable yet evolving self-modulating systems
- **Cross-module experimentation** - try connecting any output to any input - SOMA encourages this

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Practice touch techniques** - develop consistent pressure and timing for reliable live performance
- **Prepare patch templates** - document successful alligator clip configurations for quick setup
- **Use sustain recognition** - hold sensors for melodic lines, tap for percussion within the same performance

**Sound Design Excellence:**
- **Layer different synthesis approaches** - combine percussive hits with sustained tones using sustain recognition
- **Exploit the unique sound generators** - each of the four has completely different sonic character
- **Process external audio** - use Pulsar's effects as analog processing for other instruments
