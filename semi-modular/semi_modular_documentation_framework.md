# Semi-Modular Documentation Framework
**Comprehensive Standards for Semi-Modular, Groovebox, and Hybrid Instrument Documentation**

---

## Framework Overview

This framework establishes comprehensive documentation standards for semi-modular synthesizers, grooveboxes, and hybrid instruments. Unlike individual module documentation, these guides cover complete instruments while maintaining the educational progression and practical focus established in the modular documentation project.

### **Design Philosophy**
- **Standalone Completeness:** Each guide is self-contained and doesn't require other documentation
- **Basic Synthesis Assumed:** Assumes understanding of oscillators, filters, envelopes, and basic modulation
- **Progressive Mastery:** Builds from instrument basics to advanced system integration and performance techniques
- **System Integration Focus:** Shows how each instrument can anchor or enhance different musical setups
