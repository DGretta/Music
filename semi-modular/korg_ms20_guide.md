## Quick Start: Create Your First Classic Analog Voice in 5 Minutes

**What is the MS-20?** The synthesizer that taught the world what analog electronic music sounds like - from Daft Punk's legendary setup to countless electronic music classics, the MS-20's aggressive filter and warm oscillators created the template that every modern analog synth tries to recreate.

### Your First Legendary Analog Voice
1. **Power on** - the MS-20 boots up ready to make sound with no patching required
2. **Set VCO-1 FREQUENCY** to around 12 o'clock position
3. **Turn VCO-1 LEVEL** (mixer section) clockwise to 2 o'clock
4. **Set VCF CUTOFF FREQUENCY** to 1 o'clock position
5. **Turn up VCF RESONANCE** to around 11 o'clock (hear that Korg bite!)
6. **Play the keyboard** - instant classic analog synthesis
7. **Adjust VCF CUTOFF** while playing to hear the legendary MS-20 filter sweep

**Congratulations!** You just created the foundational analog voice that influenced decades of electronic music - the same warm oscillators and aggressive filter character that made Daft Punk's "Discovery" possible!

## Essential Interface (The MS-20 Classic Architecture)

### **Classic Analog Signal Chain:**
- **VCO-1 & VCO-2:** Two independent analog oscillators with saw, square, and triangle waves
- **VCF (Voltage Controlled Filter):** The legendary Korg filter with high-pass and low-pass modes
- **VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifier):** Classic analog amplitude control with envelope shaping
- **EG-1 & EG-2:** Dual envelope generators for filter and amplitude modulation
- **MG (Modulation Generator):** Triangle and square wave LFO for classic modulation effects
- **External Signal Processor (ESP):** Process any external audio through MS-20 analog circuits

### **The Revolutionary Patchbay System:**
- **Semi-modular design:** Works immediately without patching, cables override internal connections
- **Comprehensive routing:** Audio and CV patch points for every major function
- **Educational clarity:** Each patch point clearly labeled with function and signal type
- **External integration:** CV inputs and outputs for connecting with other synthesizers and sequencers

### **Signal Flow Understanding:**
- **Internal Path:** VCO → VCF → VCA → Output (classic subtractive synthesis)
- **Modulation Routes:** EG-1 controls VCF, EG-2 controls VCA, MG provides LFO modulation
- **External Processing:** ESP allows external audio to bypass internal oscillators
- **Patch Override:** Any internal connection can be replaced with patch cables for creative routing

## Beginner "Gotchas" & Pro Tips

### **⚠️ Common Mistakes:**

**"The filter doesn't sound aggressive enough!"**
- **MS-20 filter shines with higher resonance settings** - don't be afraid to push resonance past 12 o'clock
- **Solution:** Turn resonance to 2-3 o'clock range and adjust cutoff for that legendary Korg bite

**"I can't get the ESP to work with my audio"**
- **ESP requires proper signal levels and routing** - it's not a simple audio input
- **Solution:** Check ESP input level, use proper signal source, and understand ESP's unique processing character

**"My patches sound thin compared to Daft Punk"**
- **Classic analog thickness requires specific techniques** - layer oscillators, use slight detuning, process through analog effects
- **Solution:** Detune VCO-2 slightly, use both oscillators, and process final output through analog compression/distortion

**"The keyboard tracking seems off"**
- **Vintage analog synths require periodic calibration** - especially 40+ year old instruments
- **Solution:** Professional calibration service or careful adjustment following service manual procedures

### **🎵 Pro Tips:**

**Legendary Filter Techniques:**
- **The Daft Punk sweep:** Start with cutoff low, resonance high, sweep cutoff while playing for signature filter movement
- **Self-oscillation mastery:** Push resonance to maximum, tune with cutoff knob for using filter as additional oscillator
- **ESP magic:** Process drums, vocals, any audio through ESP for instant vintage analog character

**Classic Analog Production:**
- **Vintage thickness:** Always use both VCO-1 and VCO-2, detune slightly for classic analog warmth
