# Noise Engineering Loquelic Iteritas - Beginner's Guide

**The Three-Algorithm Digital Beast**

---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Complex Sound in 5 Minutes

**What is Loquelic Iteritas?** Think of it as three different synthesizers in one compact module. It's a digital complex oscillator that implements interpretations of three classic synthesis algorithms: VOSIM (vocal simulation), Summation Synthesis, and Phase Modulation. Each algorithm creates dramatically different sounds, from woody vocal textures to harsh metallic tones. It's designed for both musicians and sound designers who want access to unique, cutting-edge digital synthesis.

### Your First VOSIM Sound
1. **Connect Loquelic Iteritas OUT** ‚Üí **your mixer or audio interface**
2. **Set mode switch** to **VO** (VOSIM mode)
3. **Connect keyboard/sequencer CV** ‚Üí **1V/8VA input**
4. **Turn MORPH knob** slowly and listen to the timbral changes
5. **Try FOLD knob** to add harmonic complexity via wavefolding
6. **Experiment with MODULATE** to hear the oscillators interact

**Congratulations!** You've just experienced one of the most unique oscillators in Eurorack!

## Essential Parameters (The Algorithm Triad)

### **1. Three Synthesis Algorithms - The Core Magic**
- **VO (VOSIM):** Based on 1970s vocal simulation - creates woody, vocal-like tones
- **SS (Summation Synthesis):** Mathematical approach using harmonic series - complex spectra
- **PM (Phase Modulation):** Two-oscillator PM with amplitude modulation - metallic, bell-like sounds

## Beginner "Gotchas"

### **Algorithm Mode Completely Changes Everything**
- **Same knob settings = totally different sounds** across VO/SS/PM modes
- **No "normal" oscillator sounds** - all three algorithms are specialized
- **Controls behave differently** in each mode (MORPH does different things)
- **Start with one algorithm** - master VO, then SS, then PM
- **Don't expect familiar behavior** - this isn't a traditional VCO

### **It's Not a Traditional Oscillator**
- **No sine/saw/square waves** - these are complex synthesis algorithms
- **Can be harsh and digital** - embrace the character, don't fight it
- **Not always "musical"** in traditional sense - designed for unique sounds
- **Tuning can be tricky** - algorithms may not track perfectly across all ranges
- **Loud output levels** - may need attenuation for some systems

### **CV Input Normalling Confusion**
- **1V/8VA and 1V/8VB are cross-normalled** by default
- **Both oscillators track same CV** when only one input patched
- **Patch both inputs** for independent oscillator control
- **This is intentional** - allows single CV to control both, or independent control
- **Check your patching** if harmonic relationships seem off

### **Continuous Tone Control Philosophy**
- **Designed for constant movement** - static sounds may seem boring
- **All four tone controls want CV modulation** for best results
- **Not a "set and forget" oscillator** - rewards active manipulation
- **LFOs are your friend** - multiple slow LFOs create evolving textures
- **Think like a sound designer** rather than traditional synthesist

### **Variable Sample Rate Technology**
- **Aliasing is intentionally musical** - not a bug, it's a feature
- **Digital artifacts are part of the sound** - embrace them
- **Sample rate changes with pitch** to make aliasing harmonically related
- **Can sound "broken" at extreme settings** - this is often desirable
- **Trust your ears** over technical expectations

## Next Steps

1. **Master one algorithm at a time** - spend sessions focusing on just VO, SS, or PM
2. **Learn the tone control behaviors** - understand what each knob does in each mode
3. **Experiment with independent pitch control** - explore harmonic relationships
4. **Add modulation sources** - LFOs and envelopes bring these algorithms to life
5. **Embrace the extreme settings** - the "broken" sounds are often the most interesting
6. **Study the source material** - research VOSIM, summation synthesis, and PM techniques

**Remember:** Loquelic Iteritas is designed to sound unique, not familiar. Let it teach you new approaches to synthesis!
