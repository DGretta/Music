# Mutable Instruments Marbles - Beginner's Guide
*The Intelligent Chaos Generator with Musical Memory*

---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Random Sequence in 5 Minutes

**What is Marbles?** Think of it as a dice-rolling robot that learns your musical preferences. It generates random rhythms and melodies, but with intelligence - it can repeat good ideas, avoid bad ones, and gradually evolve patterns over time. It's chaos with musical taste.

### Your First Random Pattern
1. **Connect Marbles X1 output** → **Oscillator 1V/OCT input**
2. **Connect Marbles t2 output** → **Envelope generator TRIGGER input**
3. **Set RATE knob** to around 12 o'clock (120 BPM)
4. **Turn STEPS knob** clockwise to 2 o'clock (quantized to scales)
5. **Play with DEJA VU knob** - turn right to create repeating loops

**Congratulations!** You've just created an evolving random melody that can lock into memorable patterns!

## Essential Parameters (The Big 6)

### **1. RATE Knob (Master Clock)**
- **What it does:** Sets the master tempo for everything (internal clock)
- **Musical result:** 120 BPM at 12 o'clock - your main pulse
- **Range:** Super slow to very fast - covers all musical tempos
- **Pro tip:** Has V/Oct input - you can sequence the tempo changes!

### **2. DEJA VU Knob (The Memory)**
- **What it does:** Controls how much the module remembers and repeats
- **Left (7-12 o'clock):** Random to perfect loops  
- **Right (12-5 o'clock):** Perfect loops to shuffled variations
- **Sweet spot:** 11 o'clock for slowly evolving patterns
- **Magic moment:** At 12 o'clock exactly = perfect locked loop

### **3. STEPS Knob (Musical Shape)**
- **What it does:** Controls how "musical" the random voltages sound
- **Left of center:** Smooth, flowing random curves (great for modulation)
- **Center:** Traditional stepped random voltages
- **Right of center:** Progressively quantized to musical scales
- **Far right:** Only root notes and oct
