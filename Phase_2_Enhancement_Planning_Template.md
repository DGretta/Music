## Pre-Enhancement Analysis

### **1. Current Guide Assessment**
- [ ] **Read entire guide** - Understand existing structure and content
- [ ] **Identify unique character** - What makes this module special/different?
- [ ] **Note existing sections** - What's already covered well vs needs enhancement?
- [ ] **Check current patch count** - How many basic patches exist?
- [ ] **Assess tone/style** - What's the existing voice and approach?

### **2. Module Character Analysis**

## Implementation Efficiency Plan

### **Edit Sequence (Minimize Function Calls)**
1. **Single edit:** Add all three Phase 2 patches after existing patches
2. **Single edit:** Update entire "Pairs Well With" section
3. **Single edit:** Add complete Phase 2 Learning Path section
4. **Single edit:** Update Bottom Line
5. **Single edit:** Fix any formatting issues discovered

### **ASCII Diagram Standards**
- **Cable colors:** Audio (Red), CV (Blue), Gate (Yellow)
- **Module representation:** Consistent box format with proper connections
- **Signal flow:** Clear directional indicators
- **Integration tables:** Consistent format with Purpose/Synergy columns

### **Language Standards Check**
- [ ] **No AI/intelligence references** - Use circuit-based language
- [ ] **Module-specific terminology** - Honor the module's unique language
- [ ] **Consistent Phase 2 integration** - Organic/Chaos/Patterns approach
- [ ] **Educational progression** - Clear learning objectives throughout

## Quality Verification Checklist

### **Before Implementation:**
- [ ] **Complete plan created** - All sections designed
- [ ] **Unique character honored** - Phase 2 enhances, doesn't replace
- [ ] **Efficient edit sequence** - Minimal function calls planned
- [ ] **Language standards confirmed** - No prohibited terms, consistent terminology

### **After Implementation:**
- [ ] **All Phase 2 patches added** - Organic, Chaos, Complete Ecosystem
- [ ] **Enhanced "Pairs Well With"** - Phase 2 synergies included
- [ ] **Complete Learning Path** - Full educational progression
- [ ] **Updated Bottom Line** - Reflects Phase 2 integration role
- [ ] **Format consistency** - ASCII diagrams and tables properly formatted
- [ ] **Language compliance** - Circuit-based descriptions throughout

## Module-Specific Considerations

### **Special Cases to Consider:**
- **Unique module philosophy** (e.g., Soma's "organismic," Mutable's "laboratory")
- **Specific technical approaches** (e.g., analog vs digital, algorithms)
- **Brand voice and terminology** (respect manufacturer's language)
- **Musical context and applications** (genre-specific vs general purpose)
- **Integration complexity** (some modules need simpler or more complex approaches)

### **Alternative Module Suggestions:**
- **Primary examples:** Use your collection for tested, verified patches
- **Also try format:** Include accessible alternatives with character differences
- **Budget alternatives:** Consider 2HP, Doepfer, DIY options
- **Function-based organization:** Group by what modules do, not specific brands

**Remember:** This planning phase should take 10-15 minutes but will save hours of rework and create much better, more cohesive enhancements. Every guide should feel intentionally designed rather than randomly enhanced.
