# Phase 2 Enhancement Planning Template

**Use this template BEFORE starting any guide enhancement to ensure efficient, cohesive implementation**

---

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL CHANGE: Remove "Beginner's" from Guide Titles**

### **New Naming Convention:**
- **OLD:** `[Module Name] - Beginner's Guide`
- **NEW:** `[Module Name] - Guide`
- **Reason:** Guides serve all skill levels with progressive content from quick start to expert integration

### **Implementation:**
- **New guides:** Always use `[Module Name] - Guide` format
- **Enhancement planning:** Note title change needed for existing guides
- **Internal references:** Update all cross-references to match new naming

---

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE: Avoid Repetitive Modulation Patterns**

### **Problem Identified:**
**Repetitive "Phase 2 Trinity" Pattern:**
- Multiple guides using identical **DivKid Ochd + Make Noise Wogglebug + Mutable Marbles** combinations
- Same expert patch template across different modules (Pico Voice, Punch v3, Moon Phase, Loquelic, Cs-L, etc.)
- Creates frustrating repetition for users
- Prevents patch combination since all guides compete for same modulation sources
- Ignores unique character and natural partners of each target module

### **❌ What NOT To Do:**
```
Every Expert Patch:
DivKid Ochd + Make Noise Wogglebug + Mutable Marbles + [Target Module]
```
**Problems:**
- 30+ HP requirement for every advanced patch
- Expensive barrier to entry
- Boring repetition across guides
- Can't combine multiple guide patches
- Generic approach ignores module-specific needs

### **✅ Better Approach - Unique Multi-Function Ecosystems:**

**Each guide should use different multi-function module combinations:**
- **Pico Voice:** Hermod+ (seq+quant+trig) + MetaModule (Fundamental VCO + AS ADSR) + Pico Voice
- **Loquelic:** Bloom (generative CV/gates) + Disting (algorithm-specific processing) + Function Junction
- **Granular:** Maths (complex modulation) + Cellz (touch control) + target module
- **Each module leverages multi-function capabilities appropriately**

**Multi-Function Module Capabilities:**
- **Hermod+:** Sequencer + quantizer + trigger gen + CV processor + live recording
- **MetaModule:** Any function via plugins (specify plugin names: Fundamental VCO, AS ADSR, Mutable Instruments, etc.)
- **Disting mk4:** 80+ algorithms (quantizers, LFOs, S&H, triggers, envelopes, logic)
- **Maths:** Function gen + envelope + LFO + logic + slew + much more
- **Bloom:** Generative sequencer + trigger gen + CV source + probability
- **Function Junction:** CV processor + mixer + modifier + attenuverter
- **Cellz:** Touch sequencer + trigger gen + CV source + performance controller

### **Design Principles:**
1. **Multi-Function Module Awareness:** Recognize that modules like Hermod+, MetaModule, Disting serve multiple roles simultaneously
2. **Plugin Specificity:** When referencing MetaModule, specify actual plugin names (Fundamental VCO, AS ADSR, etc.)
3. **Non-Overlapping Multi-Function Combinations:** Different guides use different multi-function approaches
4. **Realistic Collection Usage:** Only reference modules actually owned, verify availability
5. **Combinable Multi-Function Patches:** Users should be able to run multiple guide patches using different multi-function combinations
6. **Practical Multi-Function HP:** Consider realistic rack space for multi-function workflows
7. **Unique Multi-Function Character:** Each ecosystem should demonstrate different multi-function capabilities
8. **Educational Multi-Function Value:** Show different approaches to leveraging multi-function modules

### **Evaluation Questions:**
- Does this patch leverage multi-function module capabilities appropriately?
- Are MetaModule plugins specified by actual name (not generic "plugin")?
- Does this use the same multi-function combination as other guides?
- Can this patch be combined with patches from other guides using different multi-function approaches?
- Are these multi-function partners musically appropriate for this module?
- Do we actually own all these modules (no assumptions about missing modules)?
- Does this ecosystem teach something unique about multi-function modular synthesis?
- Are we showcasing different multi-function capabilities across guides?

## ⚠️ **EXECUTION EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS**

### **BEFORE ANY WRITING - VERIFY:**
- [ ] **Complete plan presented to user for approval** 
- [ ] **User confirmed plan before any file operations**
- [ ] **Single write operation planned** - No iterative attempts
- [ ] **File path verified** - Check directory structure first
- [ ] **Template sections identified** - Know exactly what goes where

### **FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:**
- **❌ NEVER start writing without user confirmation of plan**
- **❌ NEVER make multiple write attempts** - Get it right the first time
- **❌ NEVER commit without verifying file exists**
- **❌ NEVER use edit operations on files that may not exist**
- **❌ NEVER proceed after file operation failures without diagnosis**

### **REQUIRED EXECUTION SEQUENCE:**
1. **PLAN** - Complete analysis, present to user
2. **CONFIRM** - Get explicit user approval 
3. **SINGLE WRITE** - One complete file write operation
4. **VERIFY** - Confirm file exists before any other operations
5. **COMMIT** - Git operations only after verification

## Module-Specific Considerations

### **Special Cases to Consider:**
- **Unique module philosophy** (e.g., Soma's "organismic," Mutable's "laboratory")
- **Specific technical approaches** (e.g., analog vs digital, algorithms)
- **Brand voice and terminology** (respect manufacturer's language)
- **Musical context and applications** (genre-specific vs general purpose)
- **Integration complexity** (some modules need simpler or more complex approaches)

### **Alternative Module Suggestions:**
- **Primary examples:** Use your collection for tested, verified patches
- **Also try format:** Include accessible alternatives with character differences
- **Budget alternatives:** Consider 2HP, Doepfer, DIY options
- **Function-based organization:** Group by what modules do, not specific brands

**Remember:** This planning phase should take 10-15 minutes but will save hours of rework and create much better, more cohesive enhancements. Every guide should feel intentionally designed rather than randomly enhanced.
