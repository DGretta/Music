**The Analog Stereo Filter Sculptor**

## Why This Instrument Excels

### **The Philosophy: Stereo Processing as Performance Tool**

Pkhia MK2 embodies **complete stereo signal control** - dual analog filters with pre-filter VCAs in 10HP. This isn't just space-saving; it's architectural thinking where filtering and amplitude control work as coordinated system rather than separate stages. The design recognizes that stereo isn't just "two channels" - it's a performance space where independent control of frequency and dynamics per channel creates width, movement, and three-dimensional sound.

**Why integration matters:**
- **Reduces complexity:** Instead of patching separate filters + separate VCAs, you have complete stereo processing suite
- **Enables stereo thinking:** Both filter cutoff AND amplitude per channel means true stereo sculpting, not just dual-mono
- **Maintains flexibility:** Everything can be used independently - integration doesn't force you into stereo-only operation
- **Teaches system design:** Understanding how filter+VCA coordination works teaches modular thinking at all scales

**The fundamental principle:** Analog stereo processing benefits from integrated control where frequency shaping and amplitude control work together as designed system. Pkhia MK2 demonstrates that "filter + VCA" isn't two modules - it's one complete processor when components enhance each other through thoughtful coordination.

### **The Innovation: Multi-Mode Outputs with Pre-Filter VCA Integration**

Most stereo filters give you one filter type with VCA elsewhere in your system. Pkhia MK2 provides **three simultaneous filter modes per channel** (LP/BP/HP) with **integrated VCA control** - fundamentally different approach:

**Traditional stereo filtering:**
- Choose one filter mode (LP or BP or HP)
- VCA separate in signal chain (before or after filter)
- Stereo = two independent mono signal paths
- Width comes from different audio sources

**Pkhia MK2 filtering:**
- Use all three modes simultaneously per channel
- VCA integrated before filters (pre-filter dynamics)
- Stereo = coordinated dual processing with independent control
- Width comes from different filter frequencies + different VCA levels

**Why this innovation matters:**

**Frequency splitting becomes natural:** LP output to bass frequencies, HP output to high frequencies, BP output to mids - one source becomes three-way frequency split with independent amplitude control per band. This is what "multi-mode" actually means in practice.

**Stereo width through processing:** Different cutoff frequencies per channel + different VCA levels per channel creates stereo width from mono sources. Not just panning - actual frequency-based stereo image creation.

**Performance-oriented design:** Real-time control over both frequency (filters) and amplitude (VCAs) per channel means you're playing the stereo field, not just setting it. Touch, sequencers, expression - everything modulates complete stereo processing.

**Teaching moment:** This demonstrates **parallel processing architecture** - same signal through multiple processors simultaneously. Understanding Pkhia's multi-mode outputs teaches you how multi-band processing works throughout synthesis and mixing. Multi-mode isn't feature - it's fundamental processing architecture.

### **The Practical Benefits: 10HP Complete Stereo Processor**

**As Stereo Filter + VCA:**
- Complete stereo processing in minimal space
- Independent cutoff per channel for stereo width
- Independent VCA per channel for stereo dynamics
- Linked control (both channels simultaneously) or individual control
- Multi-mode outputs for frequency splitting

**As Dual-Mono Processor:**
- Two completely independent mono channels
- Different audio sources through separate filters
- Different VCA envelopes per voice
- Different filter modes per source
- Essentially two mono processors in one module

**As Performance Filter:**
- Real-time control over cutoff + amplitude
- CV control responsive to touch interfaces
- Sequenceable filter + VCA patterns
- Performance-oriented for live interaction
- Dynamic stereo field creation

**As Frequency Splitter:**
- Three outputs per channel (LP/BP/HP)
- Same source becomes multi-band processor
- Different filter modes to different destinations
- Frequency-based mixing capabilities
- Parallel processing in one module

**Integration advantages:**
- VCA before filter means dynamics don't affect filter response
- Multiple outputs mean parallel routing without splitters
- Stereo operation doesn't require dual modules
- Small HP count relative to functionality
- Hand-built European analog quality

### **Perfect For:**

**Stereo System Builders:**

- **European production:** Hand-assembled with attention to analog detail
- **Efficient power consumption:** 50mA @ +12V / 10mA @ -12V
- **Shallow depth:** 20mm fits most cases easily

### **The Magic:**

Pkhia MK2 proves that **integration beats separation when design is intentional**. Separate filter + separate VCA give you two tools. Integrated filter+VCA designed to enhance each other give you complete stereo processor. Multiple outputs don't just split signal - they create parallel processing architecture where one source becomes orchestrated frequency bands.

The multi-mode outputs reveal this: use modes independently when needed, use them together for frequency splitting when musical. The VCA isn't afterthought - it's integrated element that makes stereo dynamics musical rather than technical.

**Using Pkhia MK2 teaches you stereo processing at system level:** not "what does this filter do" but "how do frequency and amplitude coordinate toward stereo musical goals." When you understand Pkhia's integration, you understand how to design patches where processors enhance each other through deliberate stereo coordination.

**From beginner's first stereo filter to expert's performance processor, Pkhia MK2 grows with understanding.** That's not marketing - that's intentional design where simple stereo use reveals itself naturally while multi-mode depth waits for exploration. Dual tools with coordinated control through integrated analog architecture.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### **"I'm not getting any sound out of the module!"**
**Problem:** VCA CV inputs have no voltage, so VCAs are closed and blocking signal

**Why It Happens:** Pkhia MK2 has **pre-filter VCAs** - the VCA stage comes BEFORE the filters in the signal path. If VCA CV inputs receive no voltage (or voltage at zero), the VCAs are completely closed, blocking all audio before it even reaches the filters. Unlike modules where filters always pass audio, Pkhia requires VCA CV to open the amplitude gates. This is by design - it gives you dynamic control over what reaches the filters.

**This teaches:** Understanding signal flow architecture - where components sit in the chain fundamentally affects behavior. Pre-filter VCA means amplitude control happens first, then frequency shaping. This is different from post-filter VCA (common in synth voices) where filtering happens first, then amplitude. Neither is better - they serve different musical purposes.

**Solution:**
- Patch envelope or gate to **vca ●●** input (controls both channels)
- Or patch separate envelopes to **vca ●** and **vca ●●** for independent channel control
- Start with constant voltage (5V) to vca inputs to confirm signal path works
- Check VCA level knobs aren't at zero (if module has VCA level controls)
- Remember: VCA CV needs to be present for ANY sound to pass through

### **"My stereo source sounds mono through Pkhia!"**
**Problem:** Using only one input or not understanding stereo routing through filters

**Why It Happens:** True stereo requires audio in BOTH i ● (left) and i ●● (right) inputs. If you patch only left input, only left channel processes - right channel has no audio. Additionally, if both filter cutoffs are set identically with identical VCA levels, even true stereo sounds mono because both channels process identically. Stereo isn't just "two channels" - it's different processing per channel creating stereo image.

**This teaches:** Stereo processing requires either different source material per channel OR different processing per channel. Pkhia creates stereo width through independent cutoff frequencies and independent VCA levels per channel. Understanding this teaches you how stereo imaging actually works - it's about differences between channels, not just separation.

**Solution:**
- Patch both left AND right audio to i ● and i ●● inputs
- Set different cutoff frequencies per channel (left at 10 o'clock, right at 2 o'clock)
- Use different VCA envelopes per channel for rhythmic stereo movement
- Or: patch mono to left only, but modulate each channel differently for stereo width from mono
- Experiment with extreme cutoff differences to hear stereo width creation

### **"The CV inputs don't seem to do anything!"**
**Problem:** Not understanding normalling behavior or linked vs individual CV inputs

**Why It Happens:** Pkhia has both linked inputs (cvf ●●, vca ●●) and individual inputs (cvf ●, cvf ●●, vca ●, vca ●●). When you patch cvf ●● (linked filter CV), it controls BOTH channels. If you then patch individual cvf ● or cvf ●● expecting to add more modulation, you might have normalling that overrides or the linked input takes priority. Understanding the routing architecture requires reading the manual - different modules implement CV routing differently.

**This teaches:** CV routing in modular isn't always intuitive - modules have different philosophies about how multiple CV inputs interact. Some sum, some override, some have priority. Understanding this teaches you to test CV routing systematically rather than assuming how it works.

**Solution:**
- Start with linked inputs only (cvf ●●, vca ●●) to control both channels
- Use individual inputs (cvf ●, cvf ●●, vca ●, vca ●●) for independent channel control
- If unsure about routing, test one input at a time and observe response
- Check if individual inputs override linked inputs or if they sum
- May need attenuators if CV amounts are too strong
- Verify CV polarity - some sources may need inversion

### **"I can't hear the filter doing anything!"**
**Problem:** Filter cutoff set too high (fully open) or audio has no frequency content in the filter's range

**Why It Happens:** Low-pass filters only remove frequencies ABOVE the cutoff point. If cutoff is fully clockwise (wide open), no frequencies are removed - the filter does nothing audible. Similarly, if your audio source is pure bass (like a sub-bass sine wave) and you're using high-pass filter output, there are no high frequencies to pass through, so you hear nothing or very little.

**This teaches:** Filters are frequency-selective - they affect specific frequency ranges. Understanding where your audio's frequency content lives relative to cutoff frequency is fundamental to all filtering. A low-pass filter with cutoff above your audio's highest frequencies is effectively bypassed.

**Solution:**
- Start with cutoff at 12 o'clock (middle), then sweep to hear filter effect
- Use lp output for bass-heavy sources, hp output for treble-heavy sources
- Try all three outputs (lp/bp/hp) to understand where frequency content is
- Patch LFO to cutoff CV and listen to how different frequencies emerge
- Remember: you can only filter frequencies that exist in the source audio

### **"The filter self-oscillates and I don't want that!"**
**Problem:** Resonance set too high, causing filter to ring or whistle

**Why It Happens:** Analog filters use feedback to create resonance (frequency emphasis). At high resonance settings, the feedback becomes strong enough to cause self-oscillation - the filter generates its own sine wave at the cutoff frequency. This is normal analog behavior, not a malfunction. Many musicians use self-oscillation musically (it's a sine wave oscillator), but if you want subtle filtering, high resonance fights against that.

**This teaches:** Resonance and self-oscillation reveal how analog filters work through feedback. Understanding that high resonance = strong feedback = potential self-oscillation teaches you about feedback systems throughout analog synthesis. Every resonant analog filter can self-oscillate if pushed hard enough.

**Solution:**
- Reduce resonance control if module has one (Pkhia may not have dedicated resonance control)
- If no resonance control, the filter may be designed for specific resonance characteristics
- Use self-oscillation musically as additional sine wave oscillator
- Lower cutoff frequency changes self-oscillation pitch if you want to keep resonance high
- Some filters are designed to self-oscillate easily - embrace it as feature, not bug

### **"I'm using all six outputs and getting phase issues!"**
**Problem:** Using multiple filter mode outputs simultaneously creates phase relationships that can cause cancellation

**Why It Happens:** LP, BP, and HP outputs from the same filter are phase-shifted relative to each other. When you mix them together (especially LP + HP), they can partially cancel each other depending on the cutoff frequency and how you're mixing them. This is normal behavior for multi-mode filters - the modes are derived from the same filter core with different phase relationships.

**This teaches:** Multi-mode outputs aren't just "different EQ settings" - they're phase-shifted versions of the filtered signal. Understanding this teaches you about phase relationships in filtering, why some combinations work musically and others create thin sounds, and how parallel processing affects phase.

**Solution:**
- Use one filter mode at a time per channel for predictable results
- If mixing modes, listen carefully for cancellation and adjust mix levels
- Use different modes to different destinations rather than mixing back together
- Embrace phase interactions as creative effect when they sound good
- Understand that this is normal multi-mode filter behavior, not a problem to fix
- Pan different modes differently in stereo field to reduce cancellation issues

### **"What does the mystery switch do?"**
**Problem:** Undocumented switch with unknown function

**Why It Happens:** European small-batch modules sometimes include features that emerge during the design process but remain undocumented. The mystery switch (solid gold circle overlapping gold ring symbol) exists on the panel, but Bizarre Jezabel hasn't specified its purpose in available materials. This isn't oversight - it's sometimes intentional boutique character where discovery is part of the instrument.

**This teaches:** Not all modules have complete documentation, especially from small manufacturers. This teaches you systematic testing methodology - how to discover undocumented features through careful observation and note-taking. Every modular system has some unknowns - learning to explore them systematically is valuable skill.

**Solution:**
- Try both switch positions during different patches and note any changes
- Listen for changes in: filter response, signal routing, stereo behavior, VCA operation, tonal character
- Test with different input sources (stereo, mono, different frequency content)
- Document your findings and share with community to build collective knowledge
- Accept that some features remain mysterious - embrace exploration
- If critical to your workflow, contact Bizarre Jezabel directly

### **"Different versions have different features and I'm confused!"**
**Problem:** Multiple Pkhia versions exist with varying panel layouts and controls

**Why It Happens:** Pkhia, Pkhia MK2, and possibly other variants exist from Bizarre Jezabel. Small manufacturers iterate on designs, and different versions may have different panel layouts, control sets, or internal routing. Both known versions include dual filters with pre-filter VCAs, but specific control placement and labeling may vary. Without clear version documentation, users can get confused about which features their specific unit has.

**This teaches:** Small-batch manufacturers often iterate designs based on user feedback and component availability. Understanding that "the module" isn't one static thing but evolves across versions teaches you to verify your specific unit's capabilities rather than assuming all versions match online descriptions.

**Solution:**
- Check ModularGrid for multiple Pkhia listings to identify your version
- Take photos of your panel and compare to online images
- Contact Bizarre Jezabel with your unit's details for version confirmation
- Refer to manual for YOUR specific version (if available)
- Document your version's behavior for community knowledge
- Don't assume forum posts about "Pkhia" apply to your exact version

### **Pattern Recognition: Root Causes of Most Pkhia Issues**

After troubleshooting countless stereo filter setups, **four core misunderstandings cause 90% of problems:**

**1. Not Understanding Pre-Filter VCA Architecture**

The VCA stage comes BEFORE filtering, not after. This is fundamental to Pkhia's design but opposite of typical synthesizer voice architecture (oscillator → filter → VCA).

**Why this causes problems:** Users expect filters to pass audio automatically, then VCA to control output level. With pre-filter VCA, no VCA CV = no audio reaches filters = complete silence. The filters never even see the signal.

**What this teaches:** Signal flow architecture matters fundamentally. Pre-filter VCA allows dynamic control over what reaches the filters (useful for performance), while post-filter VCA shapes already-filtered audio (common in synthesis voices). Understanding this teaches you that module order in signal chain creates completely different musical capabilities.

**2. Expecting Stereo to Happen Automatically**

Stereo isn't just "two channels" - it's different processing per channel creating stereo image through differences.

**Why this causes problems:** Users patch stereo source with identical settings on both channels and wonder why it sounds mono. Or they patch mono source to left only and expect automatic stereo width. Stereo requires either different source material OR different processing (cutoff/VCA/modulation) per channel.

**What this teaches:** Stereo imaging is about differences between channels. Pkhia creates stereo width through independent control of frequency (cutoff) and amplitude (VCA) per channel. This teaches you how stereo actually works in audio - it's contrast between channels, not just separation.

**3. Misunderstanding Multi-Mode Outputs and Phase**

LP, BP, and HP outputs from the same filter are phase-shifted relative to each other, not just "different EQ curves."

**Why this causes problems:** Users mix multiple filter modes together and get thin, phasey sounds from partial cancellation. Or they expect to use all six outputs (three per channel) simultaneously without understanding phase relationships.

**What this teaches:** Multi-mode filters derive different outputs from the same filter core with different phase relationships. Understanding this teaches you about phase in parallel processing, why some combinations work musically and others don't, and how multi-band processing actually functions. This knowledge applies to every multi-mode filter and multi-band processor.

**4. Not Testing CV Routing Systematically**

Linked CV inputs (cvf ●●, vca ●●) vs individual CV inputs (cvf ●, cvf ●●, vca ●, vca ●●) have specific routing behaviors that aren't universal across modules.

**Why this causes problems:** Users patch multiple CV sources expecting them to sum or interact in specific ways, but different modules handle CV routing differently (sum, override, priority). Without testing systematically, you don't know which behavior your module implements.

**What this teaches:** CV routing isn't standardized in modular synthesis. Understanding this teaches you to test CV inputs systematically with each new module rather than assuming how they'll behave. This is fundamental modular skill - systematic testing over assumptions.

**The Deeper Pattern:**

These four misunderstandings reveal underlying issue: **expecting Pkhia to behave like typical modules when it has specific architectural decisions that make it different.** Pre-filter VCA, integrated stereo processing, multi-mode outputs, and specific CV routing are all intentional design choices that serve musical purposes. Issues you encounter aren't "problems to fix" - they're invitations to understand stereo filtering more deeply.

When you master pre-filter VCA architecture, stereo width creation through processing, multi-mode phase relationships, and systematic CV testing, you're ready for advanced stereo modular patching - because you understand the principles, not just the procedures.

**Understanding these four patterns prevents 90% of Pkhia frustration and teaches transferable stereo processing concepts.**

## Next Steps

1. **Master each filter mode individually** - understand LP, BP, and HP responses
2. **Explore CV modulation** - try different LFO speeds and envelope shapes
3. **Experiment with routing** - stereo vs dual-mono vs mono-to-stereo
4. **Practice frequency splitting** - use different modes for multi-band effects
5. **Try parallel processing** - same source through multiple filter modes
6. **Study analog filter theory** - understand cutoff, resonance, and filter types

**Remember:** Pkhia MK2 rewards experimentation with routing - try unconventional input/output combinations!
