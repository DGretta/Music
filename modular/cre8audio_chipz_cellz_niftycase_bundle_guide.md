*Cre8audio Chipz + Cellz + NiftyCase Bundle - Complete chiptune performance ecosystem with touch control and authentic lo-fi sound generation*

**What is the Bundle?** This is a complete chiptune performance ecosystem: Cellz provides 16-pad touchscreen control, Chipz generates authentic lo-fi chiptune sounds, and NiftyCase handles MIDI-to-CV conversion plus audio output. Together, they create a powerful standalone chiptune workstation that bridges tactile control with classic gaming sounds.

### Bundle Setup Procedure

**Step 1: Physical Setup**
1. **Install Chipz in NiftyCase** - Use included screws, ensure power cable red stripe faces down
2. **Connect Cellz power** - 16-pin Eurorack power cable, red stripe down
3. **Set Cellz 5V jumper** - Set to "INTERNAL" (NiftyCase provides 5V power)
4. **Position for performance** - Cellz in front, NiftyCase behind for easy access to both

**Step 2: Audio Connections**
1. **Chipz Chip1 Out** → **NiftyCase "to out" input** (3.5mm TS cable)
2. **NiftyCase "audio out"** → **Your mixer/interface** (1/4" TS cable)
3. **Important:** Start with low levels - Chipz outputs are notoriously hot!

**Step 3: Control Connections**
1. **Cellz CV1 output** → **Chipz Chip1 CV input** (3.5mm TS cable)
2. **Cellz Gate1 output** → **Chipz trigger/gate input** (if available)
3. **Optional:** **Cellz CV2** → **Chipz Chip2 CV** for dual oscillator control

**Step 4: MIDI Setup (Optional)**
1. **Connect MIDI keyboard** → **NiftyCase MIDI in** (5-pin DIN)
2. **Or connect computer** → **NiftyCase USB** (Type B cable)
3. **Set MIDI channel to 1** on external controller

**Step 5: Power Up and Test**
1. **Power on bundle** - NiftyCase LED should illuminate
2. **Feed Cellz pads** - Hold left tune button, adjust left knob, tap pad to store pitch
3. **Test Chipz output** - Adjust NiftyCase audio output level carefully
4. **Play pads** - Touch Cellz pads to trigger chiptune sounds!

**Congratulations!** You now have a complete chiptune performance system ready for live performance or studio work!

## Essential Integration Parameters

### **Cellz Control Interface**
- **16 Touch Pads:** 4x4 hexagonal grid, each stores two 12-bit CV values (0V-5V)
- **Feeding Process:** Hold tune button + adjust knob + tap pad = store pitch
- **Two Channels:** Left/right tune buttons and knobs for independent control
- **Arpeggiator:** Hold 2+ pads = automatic arpeggiation mode
- **External Sequencing:** Up/right trigger inputs for pattern advancement
- **Scaling Modes:** Semi-tone quantized or free scaling (press both tune buttons)

### **Chipz Sound Generation**
- **Chip1 VCO:** TUNE, WAVE morphing (5 waveforms), built-in FILTER, CV inputs
- **Chip2 VCO:** TUNE, WAVE morphing, WIDTH (PWM), independent CV inputs
- **LFO:** RATE, WAVE, DEPTH, dual outputs (main + 4X speed)
- **Character:** Intentional lo-fi digital aliasing and bit-crushing
- **Hot Outputs:** May overload NiftyCase audio section without attenuation

### **NiftyCase MIDI-to-CV Hub**
- **CV Outputs:** CV1/CV2 (0-10V, 1V/octave), Gate1/Gate2 (0/5V)
- **Additional:** Mod wheel CV, Clock output, Status LED
- **Audio Section:** Two "to out" inputs summed to rear 1/4" output
- **MIDI Modes:** Channel 1/2 mono, Channel 3 duo, Channel 10 drums
- **USB + DIN:** Computer and hardware MIDI integration

### **Critical Integration Points**

**Hot Output Management (Essential):**
- **Chipz outputs are very hot** - can easily overdrive NiftyCase audio section
- **Start conservatively** - Begin with Chipz outputs at low levels
- **Monitor for distortion** - NiftyCase has no built-in attenuation
- **Solution:** Use VCAs or attenuators between Chipz and NiftyCase inputs

**Cellz → Chipz Control Mapping:**
- **CV Range:** Cellz outputs 0V-5V, Chipz expects full audio range
- **Pitch Control:** Cellz CV1 → Chipz Chip1 CV gives musical pitch control
- **Dual Control:** Cellz CV2 → Chipz Chip2 CV for dual oscillator patches
- **TUNE Knob Behavior:** When CV patched, TUNE becomes ±2 octave transposer

**Power Considerations:**
- **Cellz 5V requirement:** Set jumper to INTERNAL for NiftyCase power
- **Combined power draw:** Chipz + Cellz + additional modules
- **NiftyCase capacity:** Check total current draw against power supply specs

## Bundle "Gotchas"

### **Hot Output Management (Most Critical)**
- **Chipz outputs will overdrive NiftyCase** - this is the #1 issue new users face
- **Start with very low levels** and increase gradually
- **Invest in proper attenuation** - VCAs or attenuator modules are essential
- **Monitor constantly** - distortion can damage downstream equipment

### **Power Requirements**
- **Cellz needs 5V power** - ensure jumper is set to INTERNAL for NiftyCase systems
- **Check total power draw** - Chipz + Cellz + other modules may exceed NiftyCase capacity
- **Power sequencing** - power up NiftyCase first, then Cellz

### **Cellz Learning Curve**
- **Feeding process is non-obvious** - hold tune button while adjusting knob
- **Pad layout takes practice** - develop muscle memory for musical intervals
- **Scaling modes affect response** - semi-tone vs. free scaling behaves differently

### **Cable Management**
- **Multiple 3.5mm TS cables required** - can become tangled during performance
- **Short cables preferred** - reduces noise and keeps setup compact
- **Backup cables essential** - 3.5mm TS cables are the most likely failure point

### **Integration Complexity**
- **Three separate manuals** - each unit has its own operational requirements  
- **Multiple failure points** - power, audio, CV, and MIDI connections all must work
- **Setup time** - complete bundle configuration takes longer than single modules

## Next Steps

1. **Master basic bundle integration** - get comfortable with setup and basic operation
2. **Develop performance techniques** - practice Cellz pad playing and Chipz expression
3. **Explore MIDI integration** - add external controllers and computer integration
4. **Address hot output management** - invest in proper VCAs or attenuation
5. **Expand the system** - add complementary modules that enhance chiptune character
6. **Record and produce** - integrate bundle with recording setup for finished productions

**Remember:** This bundle rewards practice and experimentation. The combination of tactile Cellz control, authentic Chipz sounds, and versatile NiftyCase integration creates a uniquely expressive chiptune instrument that bridges classic gaming aesthetics with modern performance techniques.
