# Winterbloom Castor & Pollux II - Beginner's Guide

**The Modern Juno Twins**

---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Juno-Style Sound in 5 Minutes

**What is Castor & Pollux II?** Think of it as two Roland Juno-106 oscillators reimagined for the modern age. It contains two digitally-controlled analog oscillators (DCOs) that faithfully recreate the legendary 80s Juno sound, but with modern improvements like hard sync, built-in chorus, and USB connectivity. Named after the mythological twins, these oscillators can work independently or together to create everything from classic 80s pads to complex evolving textures.

### Your First Juno Lead Sound
1. **Connect Castor OUT** ‚Üí **your filter or audio output**
2. **Turn up Castor's RAMP mix knob** (small knob, fully clockwise)
3. **Connect keyboard/sequencer CV** ‚Üí **Castor PITCH CV input**
4. **Play some notes** - you should hear that classic Juno sawtooth!
5. **Try the MODE button** - tap to cycle through Chorus/LFO FM/Hard Sync modes
6. **Adjust CROSSFADE knob** to blend in Pollux for thickness

**Congratulations!** You've just experienced the legendary Juno sound in Eurorack format!

## Essential Parameters (The Twin System)

### **1. The Twin Oscillators - Castor & Pollux**
- **Two identical DCOs:** Each with independent pitch control and waveform mixing
- **Castor (left):** The primary oscillator, typically your main voice
- **Pollux (right):** The secondary oscillator, often used for detuning and effects
- **Independent operation:** Each can work as separate mono oscillators
- **Coupled operation:** Use together for thick, complex sounds
- **Juno-authentic:** Faithfully recreates the original Juno 106 oscillator behavior

### **2. Pitch Control System - Smart Tuning**
- **Large pitch knobs:** Coarse frequency control for each oscillator
- **PITCH CV inputs:** 1V/octave for musical control
- **Non-linear response:** "Virtual notch" makes tuning easier around musical pitches
- **Tweak mode:** Hold MODE button + turn pitch knob for fine tuning (¬±2.5 semitones)
- **Follow vs Free modes:** Pitch knob can track 1V/oct or run free (configurable via web)
- **Pro tip:** The non-linear response makes it easier to hit exact musical intervals

### **3. Waveform System - Three Shapes Each**
- **RAMP:** Classic sawtooth waveform (bright, buzzy, perfect for leads)
- **PULSE:** Square/rectangular wave with PWM capability
- **SUB:** Sub-oscillator at -1 octave (adds bass foundation)
- **Individual mix controls:** Small knobs control how much of each wave in the mixed output
- **Mixed outputs:** Each oscillator combines its three waves into one output
- **Expander access:** 2HP expander provides individual waveform outputs

### **4. Three Operational Modes - The Magic Button**
- **MODE button:** Tap to cycle between three distinct behaviors
- **Chorus mode (blue LED):** Default mode with built-in chorus on Pollux
- **LFO FM mode (green LED):** Internal LFO modulates both oscillators' pitch
- **Hard Sync mode (pink LED):** Pollux syncs to Castor for metallic tones
- **Tweak overlay:** Hold MODE button for additional parameters in each mode
- **Visual feedback:** LED color and animations show current mode

### **5. Crossfade System - Blending the Twins**
- **CROSSFADE knob:** Blends between Castor and Pollux mixed outputs
- **CROSSFADE output:** Main output combining both oscillators
- **Full CCW:** Only Castor audible
- **12 o'clock:** Equal blend of both oscillators  
- **Full CW:** Only Pollux audible
- **Performance control:** Perfect for live morphing between sounds

### **6. Web Editor Integration - Modern Convenience**
- **USB connection:** Connect via micro USB for advanced configuration
- **Browser-based editor:** No software installation required
- **Deep customization:** LED brightness, pitch behavior, LFO settings, and more
- **Calibration:** Fine-tune oscillator accuracy and tracking
- **Open source:** All firmware and hardware designs available on GitHub

### **Patch 2: Thick Detuned Pad**
```
[Sequence] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Mult] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Castor PITCH CV]
                        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Pollux PITCH CV]
[CROSSFADE OUT] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Filter] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Reverb] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Audio out]
```
**Setup:** Detune Pollux slightly from Castor using pitch knobs
**Mix:** Both oscillators with RAMP and PULSE waves
**CROSSFADE:** Around 12 o'clock for equal blend
**Result:** Lush, beating pad sounds perfect for ambient music

### **Patch 3: Hard Sync Lead**
```
[Keyboard] ‚îÄ‚îÄ1V/OCT‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Castor PITCH CV] (stays in tune)
[LFO] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Pollux PITCH CV] (creates sync sweep)
[CROSSFADE OUT] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Audio out]
```
**Setup:** Hard Sync mode (pink LED), adjust Pollux pitch for timbral sweep
**Controls:** LFO modulates Pollux pitch for automatic sync sweeps
**Result:** Metallic, harmonically rich leads perfect for aggressive sounds
**Experiment:** Try different LFO speeds for different sweep characters

### **Patch 4: Dual Independent Oscillators**
```
[Castor OUT] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Filter 1] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Left audio]
[Pollux OUT] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Filter 2] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Right audio]
[Sequencer A] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Castor PITCH CV]
[Sequencer B] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Pollux PITCH CV]
```
**Setup:** Use each oscillator independently for different voices
**Different sequences:** Each oscillator plays different melodic lines
**Processing:** Different filters/effects for each oscillator
**Result:** Two-voice polyrhythmic sequences from one module

## Beginner "Gotchas"

### **Mode Button Behavior**
- **Tap to change modes:** Quick press cycles through the three modes
- **Hold for tweak overlay:** Long press accesses additional parameters
- **LED feedback:** Color shows mode, animations show state changes
- **Mode affects everything:** Each mode completely changes how the oscillators interact
- **Don't forget tweak mode:** Hold MODE + turn knobs for fine adjustments

### **Waveform Mix Controls Are Tiny**
- **Small trimpots:** Individual waveform levels use small knobs, not large ones
- **Easy to miss:** Beginners often overlook these crucial mixing controls
- **Full CCW = off:** Each waveform mix starts at zero
- **Combined output:** Mixed output is sum of all three waveforms
- **Start simple:** Begin with just RAMP mix up, add PULSE and SUB gradually

### **Expander Separation (Version II)**
- **Main module simplified:** Individual waveform outputs moved to separate expander
- **Expander included:** 2HP module comes with Castor & Pollux II
- **Ribbon cable connection:** Small cable connects main module to expander
- **Optional use:** You don't need the expander for basic operation
- **V1 vs V2:** Version I had all outputs on main panel, Version II uses expander

### **Web Editor Necessity**
- **Advanced features require web editor:** Some functions only accessible via browser
- **USB cable needed:** Micro USB connection to computer required
- **No mobile app:** Browser-based editor works on computers, not phones
- **Calibration important:** Factory calibration may need adjustment for your system
- **Open source advantage:** Community contributions add features over time

### **Non-Linear Pitch Response**
- **Virtual notch:** Pitch knobs are less sensitive in middle range
- **Helps tuning:** Easier to hit musical intervals like octaves and fifths
- **Can confuse:** Knob sensitivity changes across range
- **Follow mode only:** Non-linear response only when tracking CV input
- **Configurable:** Can be adjusted via web editor if desired

## Next Steps

1. **Master each mode individually** - spend time with Chorus, LFO FM, and Hard Sync modes
2. **Explore waveform mixing** - understand how RAMP, PULSE, and SUB combine
3. **Practice crossfading** - learn to blend the oscillators expressively
4. **Connect the web editor** - unlock advanced features and customization
5. **Try the expander** - explore individual waveform outputs for complex patches
6. **Experiment with detuning** - use slight pitch differences for thick sounds

**Remember:** Castor & Pollux II is both faithfully vintage and thoroughly modern - embrace both aspects!
