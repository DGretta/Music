## 1. INTRODUCTION TABLE OF CONTENTS


##### 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1. INTRODUCTION

```
Thank you for purchasing Digitakt. The Digitakt is a compact drum machine from Elektron. It contains all the
necessary tools to make people move to the beat. A digital and highly flexible sound engine, sampling capa-
bility, a live-friendly sequencer, the means to control external MIDI gear, and Overbridge support. To get the
most out of your machine, we recommend that you read this manual in its entirety.
```
### 1.1 CONVENTIONS IN THIS MANUAL

```
We have used the following conventions throughout the manual:
Key names are written in upper case, bold style and within brackets. For instance, the key labeled “FUNC”
on the main panel is written as [FUNC].
Knobs are written in upper case, bold, italic letters. For instance, the knob “Level/Data” is called LEVEL/
DATA.
Menu names are written in upper case letters. The SETTINGS menu is an example of that.
Parameter names and certain menu options where settings can be made or actions performed are written
in bold, upper case letters. For example, VOL.
Upper case letters are used for parameter setting alternatives. For example, OFF.
Messages visible on the screen are written in upper case letters with quotation marks.
For example, “QUANTIZE LIVE REC”.
LED indicators like the Chromatic LED are written like this: <CHROMATIC>.

## 2. THE DIGITAKT

## 2. THE DIGITAKT

When we started thinking about the product that was to become the Digitakt, we began by asking ourselves:
what are the ideal features and tools required to quickly make a really good sounding beat? How to define
the bare essentials? But not only that. Certain products possess an almost sparkling allure, and they give
more than they take. You just want to use them. Why do they evoke such a feeling? And thus, with these
questions in mind, the work began.

Fast forward. It’s May 2017 and Digitakt will start shipping in about a week. The Elektron HQ is bristling with
activity. Factory patterns are being made, tweaks to the Digitakt OS implemented, content for the Elektron
website created. Seeing Digitakt in almost complete form is a sight to behold. Now, switch it on. Hopefully
you will experience the same thing as we do.

The sound.
Digitakt sounds very good. Audio material handled by the sample engine appears big, full and almost
three-dimensional. Sample everything you can. Your studio gear, random clips from YouTube, everyday life.
Process and sequence. Digitakt is a sound exploration tool.

The workflow.
The streamlined approach makes beat making a focused activity. Nothing will distract you. This clarity is
one of the core features of Digitakt, and gives it a unique character. Being drawn into the Digitakt universe
is a very enjoyable experience.

The totality.
Easy sampling, sequencing of both audio and MIDI, the flexible sample engine, and Overbridge support
form a very versatile product. The provided feature set allows for depth and adaptability, and also bestows
Digitakt with a certain free-spiritedness. Something, somehow, feels alive.

Digitakt is here. And we think we have found the answers to the questions we once asked ourselves.

Sincerely,

The Elektron Team

2. Connect OUTPUT L/R from the Digitakt to your mixer or amplifier.
3. To control the Digitakt from a computer, connect a USB cable between the computer and the USB
    connector of the Digitakt.
4. If you want to use MIDI to control the Digitakt, connect the MIDI OUT port of the device you wish to
    send data from to the MIDI IN port of the Digitakt. The MIDI THRU port duplicates the data arriving at
    the MIDI IN port, so it can be used for chaining MIDI units together. Connect the MIDI OUT port of the
    Digitakt to the MIDI IN port of the of the device you want to control if you want to use Digitakt to control
    other devices using MIDI.
5. If you want to sample or process audio from external sources, connect the audio source to INPUT L/R
    or via USB (sampling only).
6. Switch on all units. Switch on the Digitakt by pressing the Power switch located at the back of the unit.

+DRIVE
Projects, Samples, Sounds
```
### 5.1 +DRIVE

```
The +Drive is a non-volatile storage. It keeps up to 128 projects stored internally, and it also holds all saved
Sounds. The +Drive also contains the sample bank. All projects have access to these samples.
```
### 5.2 DATA STRUCTURE

#### 5.2.1 PROJECT

```
A project contains 128 patterns. General settings and states are also stored in the project. When a
project is loaded it becomes the active working state of the Digitakt. From here it is possible to edit the
patterns and Sounds of the project. Every time the Digitakt is switched on, it boots to the active working
state, the active project. Projects are saved, loaded and managed in the SETTINGS menu. For more
information, please see “9. PATTERNS, KITS, SOUNDS, AND SAMPLES” on page 26.
```
#### 5.2.2 PATTERNS

```
The patterns are the primary data container for the Digitakt. 16 patterns are available for each of the
eight banks, which means that 128 patterns are available for each project. A pattern contains up to eight
Sounds (one for each audio track), sequencer data like trigs and parameter locks. It also contains the
settings on the TRIG page and BPM, length, swing and time signature settings. The pattern also contains
all the parameter settings for the eight MIDI tracks. For more information, please see “10. THE SE-
QUENCER” on page 31.
```
#### 5.2.3 SOUNDS

```
A Sound is a sample, plus all the audio track settings in the SRC, FLTR, AMP, and LFO PARAMETER
pages. Sounds are stored in the +Drive Sound library. The +Drive Sound library holds up to 2048 Sounds.
You can use the SOUND MANAGER to manage Sounds. For more information, please see “9.3 SOUND
MANAGER” on page 27, “9. PATTERNS, KITS, SOUNDS, AND SAMPLES” on page 26, and “11.
AUDIO TRACK PARAMETERS” on page 43.
```
```
When a Sound is imported to a pattern, it becomes an independent copy of the Sound on
the +Drive and is not linked to the original Sound on the +Drive. Instead, it fully becomes a
part of the pattern.
```
#### 5.2.4 SAMPLES

```
You can load up to 64 MB (about 11 minutes) of samples in a project, using a maximum of 127 sample
slots. Samples are stored in the +Drive Sample bank. Additional samples can be transferred to the Digi-
takt from a computer with the Elektron Transfer software. You also have the possibility to sample straight
into the Digitakt. For more information, please see “14. SAMPLING” on page 59.
```

##### 5. OVERVIEW OF THE DIGITAKT DATA STRUCTURE

### 5.3 ABOUT THE TRACKS

#### 5.3.1 AUDIO TRACKS AND MACHINES

```
The Digitakt has eight audio tracks (TRK 1-8). Each audio track contains one sample, and the parameter
settings in the PARAMETER pages TRIG, SRC, FLTR, AMP, and LFO.
A machine is a sound engine that uses a particular subset of the functionality of the sample playback
engine. There are several machines available for each track. Every machine has a specific set of pa-
rameters tailored to give you the most relevant and useful sound-shaping possibilities for that particular
machine. For more information, please see “APPENDIX A: MACHINES” on page 82, and “11.3 SRC
PAGE” on page 44.
To select an audio track for editing, press and hold [TRK] key and then press one of the [TRIG 1–8] keys.
```
#### 5.3.2 MIDI TRACKS

```
The Digitakt has eight dedicated MIDI tracks (TRK 9-16). They are used to control external, MIDI
equipped, gear. Each MIDI track can trigger a chord of up to four notes with adjustable parameters such
as velocity and length, control pitch bend and aftertouch, as well as eight freely assignable MIDI control
change parameters (MIDI CCs). For more information, please see “12. MIDI TRACK PARAMETERS” on
page 50. Any MIDI channel can be assigned to a MIDI track and several tracks can share the same
channel. If several tracks are assigned to the same MIDI channel the track with the lowest number has
priority regarding parameter conflicts.
The MIDI tracks function almost the same way as the audio tracks. Parameter locks, LFO modulation,
copy and paste commands are available. Each MIDI track also features micro timing, individual track
length and time signature settings. The main difference is that the MIDI tracks do not generate any sound
and the sequencer data is instead transmitted through the MIDI OUT or USB ports.
To select a MIDI track for editing, press and hold [TRK] key and then press one of the [TRIG 9–16] keys.
```
#### 5.3.3 EDITING THE TRACKS

```
The five [PARAMETER] keys open parameter pages that are used for editing the tracks.
```
- The TRIG page contains different parameters such as NOTE, VELOCITY, and other trig related pa-
    rameters.
- The SRC page hosts the parameters that deal with sample selection and editing of samples on audio
    tracks. For MIDI tracks this page has parameters such as CHANNEL, PROGRAM, and AFTERTOUCH.
- On the FLTR page, you find parameters for the multimode filter and the base-width filter on audio
    tracks. On MIDI tracks you find the CC value settings here.
- The AMP page for audio tracks hosts parameters for the amplitude envelope and effect sends. On MIDI
    tracks you find the CC select settings here.
- Finally, the LFO page hosts LFO parameters for the active track.
Use the DATA ENTRY knobs A-H to edit the corresponding parameters. Press and turn a knob to adjust
its parameter in larger increments. Press and hold a [PARAMETER] key to see the values for all param-
eters on that page. For more information, please see “11. AUDIO TRACK PARAMETERS” on page 43,
and “12. MIDI TRACK PARAMETERS” on page 50.

[NO] is used to negate, deselect or go back one or more steps.
```
```
When in a menu or sub-menu, the [NO] key can be used to go back, one step at a time, all the
way to the main screen.
```
### 6.2 PARAMETER EDITING

```
The DATA ENTRY knobs are used to change the values of the track parameters. The positions of the pa-
rameters on the screen correspond to the physical locations of the knobs on the front panel. Some of the
parameters on the screen tell you what DATA ENTRY knob controls that particular parameter.
For example “(E)”.
```
- The parameters are adjusted in larger increments if you press down the DATA ENTRY knob while turning
    it. This makes it quicker to sweep through the whole parameter range.
- Press DATA ENTRY knob + [NO] to reset the parameter to the default value.
- Press [PARAMETER] key + [PLAY] to reset all the parameters in the selected parameter page to
    default values.
- Press and hold a [PARAMETER] key to see the values for all parameters on that page.

#### 6.2.1 PARAMETER VALUE JUMP

```
Pressing [FUNC] while editing certain parameters will make the parameter values jump to appropriate
positions. The time of the Delay, for example, will jump between 16, 32, 64 and 128 and the sample tuning
will jump whole octaves.

eters in the same state as you left them when you return to your DAW project, with the useful total recall
functionality.
Read more about Overbridge use and availability on the Elektron website: https://www.elektron.se/overbridge/
```
### 6.7 CLASS COMPLIANT DEVICE

```
The Digitakt is a class compliant device (also known as plug-and-play). It means it does not require any
extra drivers to connect to your computer or other USB class compliant hosts.
The Digitakt can, therefore, stream audio and MIDI directly over USB to and from supported computers/
phones/tablets. It opens up several exciting possibilities of what you can do with your device, for example,
record audio from your device directly over USB in your DAW. For more information, please see “15.9.1 USB
CONFIG” on page 73.
```
### 6.8 BACKING UP THE DIGITAKT

## 7. QUICK START

This quick start will guide you through some of the basic operations to start using the Digitakt right away.
First, connect it as described in section “3.3 SETTING UP AND STARTING THE DIGITAKT” on page 14.

### 7.1 PLAYING THE FACTORY PRESETS

You can find a number of preset patterns, Sounds, and samples in the Digitakt. Follow the instructions below
to get started exploring your new instrument.

1. Press [BANK] and then press [TRIG 9] key to select bank A. The screen reads “BANK A : SELECT PTN”.
2. Press [TRIG 1] key to select the first pattern of bank A.
3. Press [PLAY] to listen to pattern A01.
4. Press [PTN] and then press [TRIG 2] key to select pattern A02. It will start once pattern A01 has
    reached its end. Select pattern A03 by pressing [PTN] and then press [TRIG 3] key, and so on.
5. Press [STOP] to stop playback.

#### 7.1.1 USING CHROMATIC MODE

```
You can use the [TRIG] keys to play any audio track sample chromatically.
```
1. Select the audio track to play chromatically by pressing [TRK] + one of the [TRIG 1–8] keys.
2. Press [FUNC] + [TRK] to enter CHROMATIC mode. The [TRIG] keys will light up in a pattern that
    resembles an octave of a piano keyboard. Only lit keys are playable.
3. Play the [TRIG] keys. The Sound will be pitched differently for each of the playable keys. Press the
    [ARROW] keys [UP] or [DOWN] to transpose the virtual keyboard up or down one octave.
For more information, please see “8.5.1 CHROMATIC MODE” on page 23.

```
CHROMATIC mode is an effective way to add musical variety to your beats. The timbre,
tonality and impact of playing a Sound chromatically depend on the character of the
source Sound.
```
#### 7.1.2 USING MUTE MODE

```
You can mute any of the sequencer tracks in this mode. Unlike the CHROMATIC mode, it makes no
difference which track is active when this mode is activated. You can access all tracks simultaneously.
```
1. Make sure a pattern is playing.
2. Press the [FUNC] + [BANK] key to enter MUTE mode.
3. Press any of the [TRIG] keys to mute the corresponding track. Press again to unmute. The light of
    the [TRIG] keys indicates the mute status. Unlit keys are muted tracks. Lit keys are active tracks.
For more information, please see “8.5.3 MUTE MODE” on page 24.

#### 7.1.3 TEMPO

```
To change the BPM setting, open the TEMPO menu by pressing the [TEMPO] key. Use the LEVEL/DATA
knob to change tempo. Pressing the knob while turning it changes the tempo eight BPM at a time. The
[ARROW] keys [UP] or [DOWN] change the tempo in fractional steps. Note that you can chose between
a global tempo or using a separate tempo for every pattern. Press [FUNC] + [YES] to switch between
GLOBAL and PATTERN tempo mode. On the main interface screen, you can also press and hold
[ARROW] keys [LEFT] or [RIGHT] to nudge the tempo 10% up or down temporarily. Release the key to
revert to the original tempo.
To tap a tempo setting, hold the [FUNCTION] key and tap the [TEMPO] key in a steady rhythm. After
four consecutive taps the average tempo of the taps will be calculated. By continuing tapping, the aver-
age tempo will keep on updating.
```

##### 7. QUICK START

```
When in the TEMPO menu (and with GLOBAL tempo mode selected), holding [FUNC] while turning the
LEVEL/DATA knob will not change the tempo to the selected value until the [FUNC] key is released.
While doing this, “PREP.” will flash in the bottom left corner of the screen.
```
```
Nudging the tempo is very handy when manually syncing Digitakt to a turntable or an
external sound source. Note that you do not need to be in the TEMPO menu to perform
tempo nudging.
```
#### 7.1.4 EDITING PARAMETERS

```
Each track has five PARAMETER pages. Press [PARAMETER] keys TRIG, SRC, FLTR, AMP, and LFO to
access the different PARAMETER pages. These parameters affect the sound and signal in various ways.
```
1. Make sure a pattern is playing.
2. Press [TRK] + [TRIG] keys 1-8 to select one of the eight audio tracks.
3. To change, for example, the cutoff of the filter, press the [FLTR] key to open the FILTER page.
    The parameter labeled FREQ changes the cutoff of the filter. Turn DATA ENTRY knob E to change
    the parameter value, and hear how the sound is affected.
Try out the rest of the PARAMETER page parameters to explore a variety of sound shaping possibilities.

### 7.2 SAMPLING FROM THE EXTERNAL INPUTS

```
Digitakt can also sample audio. It can sample audio from external sources, via the external inputs, and it can
also sample audio internally from the Digitakt itself.
```
1. Connect your audio source to the INPUT L/R inputs of the Digitakt.
2. Press [SAMPLING] to access the SAMPLING menu and then use DATA ENTRY knob G to set
    SOURCE to IN L+R.
3. Keep an eye on the audio input meter and play the audio source and make sure that the volume of the
    audio source is as strong as possible, but without clipping or distorting. Set MON to YES to monitor
    the incoming audio through the Digitakt.
4. Again, with an eye on the audio input meter and use DATA ENTRY knob F to set THRESHOLD just
    above the indicated background noise of the audio source (when it is not playing).
5. Use RLEN to set the length of the sampling.
6. Press [YES] to arm the sampler and then play the sound source. When the input audio exceeds the
    set THRESHOLD level, sampling will start.
7. Press [YES] when you want to stop sampling, or with an RLEN setting of 1–128, the sampling stops
    automatically. The sampling also stops if it reaches the max sampling time (33 seconds). The Digitakt
    then automatically normalizes the sample.
8. Use the DATA ENTRY knobs A and C to set the parameters TRIM START and TRIM END to trim the
    sample to the desired length. You can use the DATA ENTRY knobs B and D to zoom in and out to
    make it easier to see where to trim the sample. Press [FUNC] + [YES] to preview the sample. The pre-
    view is played back by the voice of the active track. Make sure to select an audio track as active track.
9. Press [YES] to save the sample.
10. Name the sample and press [YES] again to confirm the save.
11. Press [TRACK 1–8] to select the track to where you want to assign the sample.
For more information, please see “14. SAMPLING” on page 59.


## 8. DIGITAKT CONTROLS

## 8. DIGITAKT CONTROLS

### 8.1 TRIG KEYS

The [TRIG] keys have several uses, including for example, trigging an audio track Sound (track 1–8) from
the active pattern. (When sequencer recording is deactivated). They are also used for placing trigs in GRID
RECORDING mode. When pressed in combination with the [PTN] and [BANK] keys, they select patterns
and banks. The [TRIG] keys light up to indicate the position of placed trigs and to indicate the selected
bank and track.

### 8.2 ROTARY ENCODERS

The MASTER VOLUME is an absolute encoder, spanning roughly 320 degrees from its left extreme to its
right extreme. The LEVEL/DATA and DATA ENTRY knobs (with which you set various parameter values),
are relative encoders which may be spun any number of turns. Pressing and turning these encoders will
change their associated values at a greater speed.

### 8.3 KEY BEHAVIOR TABLE OF CONTENTS

As a group, the track selection keys ([TRIG] keys) have radio button functionality, i.e. when a new track is
set to be active, the previous one is simultaneously deactivated. Only one track can be selected at a time.
Likewise, the group consisting of the five [PARAMETER] keys have radio button functionality.

The [FUNC], [TRK], [PTN], and [BANK] keys must always be used in combination with other keys.

### 8.4 MIDI NOTES

Some functions can be triggered by sending MIDI note values from an external MIDI device (a MIDI key-
board or a computer, for example) connected to the Digitakt via a standard MIDI cable or a USB 2.0 A to B
connector cable.

Of the 128 notes in the standard MIDI range, Note numbers 0–7 correspond to notes C0 through to G0, the
leftmost octave (which is sometimes called C-2–G-2 in certain applications). These notes will trigger the
Sound of track 1 through track 8, respectively (provided they are set to their default channels 1-8). These
notes values map to each of the eight tracks, regardless of which track is active.

MIDI note numbers 12–84, that corresponds to notes C1–C7 (C5, MIDI note 60, being middle C) will trigger
the Sound of the active track in any of its 73 chromatic variations (as if played by the [TRIG] keys in CHRO-
MATIC mode, see section below), from lowest to highest pitch.

MIDI program change messages 0–127 will select pattern 1–128 (A01–H16) on the Digitakt. Additionally,
MIDI CC and NRPN messages can be sent to control various aspects of the Digitakt. For more information,
please see “APPENDIX B: MIDI” on page 88.

### 8.5 MODES

There are two special modes of operation on the Digitakt: CHROMATIC mode and MUTE mode.

#### 8.5.1 CHROMATIC MODE

```
Press [FUNC] + [TRK] (short press) to enter CHROMATIC mode. In this mode, you can play the Sound
of the active audio track (or send MIDI notes if you have an active MIDI track). With KB SCALE set to
CHROMATIC and KB FOLD set to OFF the [TRIG] keys will light up in a pattern that resembles an oc-
tave of a piano keyboard layout. Only lit keys are playable. Press [TRK] + [TRIG 1–16] keys to select the
track you want to play.
Press the trig keys to change the note pitch of the Sound. The range from [TRIG 9] key to [TRIG 16] key
is one octave. The whole range you can trig for audio tracks spans 6 octaves: middle, 1 up and 4 down.
The whole range for MIDI tracks spans eleven octaves. Press the [ARROW] keys [UP] or [DOWN], to
transpose the virtual keyboard up or down in octave steps.
Notes trigged can be recorded on the sequencer in LIVE RECORDING mode. Find out how this is done in
section “10.2.3 LIVE RECORDING MODE” on page 32.
The active state of CHROMATIC mode (the portion of the keyboard currently visible on the [TRIG] keys)
is not stored per pattern but stays in the state as it was last set.
Press [FUNC] + [TRK] to exit CHROMATIC mode.
```
#### 8.5.2 KEYBOARD SETUP MENU

```
Press [FUNC] + [TRK] (long press) to open the KEYBOARD SETUP menu. Here you get a graphical
view of which notes the [TRIG] keys play. Press [UP]/[DOWN] to transpose the keyboard up or down an
```

##### 8. DIGITAKT CONTROLS

```
octave. In this menu, you can also set different musical scales, and select the root note of the scale. Use
the DATA ENTRY knobs to change the settings. Press [NO] to exit the menu. Press [FUNC] + [TRK] to
exit CHROMATIC mode. The settings are stored in the active pattern.
```
```
KB SCALE sets the track’s scale. This setting governs which notes are playable on the Digitakt’s [TRIG]
keys to allow only notes in the set scale. For a list of all selectable keyboard scales, please see “APPEN-
DIX D: KEYBOARD SCALES” on page 93.
ROOT NOTE sets the root note for the chosen scale.
KB FOLD When set to ON, KB FOLD changes the way the notes are laid out on the [TRIG] keys and how
they are played from external MIDI devices. Now all the [TRIG] keys trigger a note. The [TRIG 9] key
plays the lowest note of the selected octave, root note and scale. The notes are then played upwards
through the scale to [TRIG 16] and then further upwards on [TRIG 1–8]. When a scale contains less than
eight notes in an octave, the “remaining” [TRIG] keys on the lower row will play the same notes as the
first [TRIG] keys on the upper row. Blue [TRIG] keys signal that they contain notes that are one or more
octaves distanced from each other.
In the following example of the whole tone scale [TRIG 15–16] keys play the same notes as the [TRIG
1–2] keys. [TRIG 1] and [TRIG 15] both plays a note that is one octave above [TRIG 9]. [TRIG 7] plays a
note that is two octaves above [TRIG 9].
```
```
You can also use an external keyboard to play the active tracks Sound chromatically.
Connect the keyboard to the Digitakt and configure the external keyboard and the Digitakt
MIDI Auto Channel (SETTINGS > MIDI CONFIG > CHANNELS) to the same MIDI channel.
Then play the keys on the external keyboard to play the active tracks Sound chromatically.
You can play the active track’s Sound chromatically even if the Digitakt is not in CHRO-
MATIC mode.
```
```
All the settings in the KEYBOARD SETUP menu are ignored for a track that uses the
Slice machine and when SLICE is set to NOTE. Instead slices play from C1 and upwards,
wrapping around after the last slice. The first slice is highlighted with a blue [TRIG] key in
KEYBOARD mode.
```
#### 8.5.3 MUTE MODE

```
You can use MUTE mode to mute any of the 16 sequencer tracks. Unlike CHROMATIC mode,
it makes no difference which track is active when you enter MUTE mode. All tracks are accessed simul-
taneously. Press any of the [TRIG] keys to mute the corresponding track. Press again to unmute. The
color of the [TRIG] keys indicates its tracks mute status. Unlit keys signify muted tracks. Lit keys signify
unmuted tracks.
There are two different versions of MUTE mode on the Digitakt:
```
- GLOBAL MUTE MODE In GLOBAL MUTE mode, the muted tracks are muted in all patterns, and the
trig [TRIG] keys are lit green.
Press [FUNC] + [BANK] to enter GLOBAL MUTE mode. If tracks are muted in GLOBAL MUTE mode,
the tracks will flash green when the pattern plays.
Press [FUNC] + [BANK] to exit GLOBAL MUTE mode.


##### 8. DIGITAKT CONTROLS

- PATTERN MUTE MODE In PATTERN MUTE mode, the muted tracks are muted only in the active
pattern, and the trig [TRIG] keys are lit purple.
Press [FUNC] + double-tap [BANK] to enter PATTERN MUTE mode. If tracks are muted in PATTERN
MUTE mode, the tracks will flash purple when the pattern plays.
Press [FUNC] + [BANK] to exit PATTERN MUTE mode.

The GLOBAL MUTE mode settings are saved together with the project. The PATTERN MUTE mode
settings are saved together with the pattern.

- You can also use QUICK MUTE to mute and unmute sequencer tracks. Press and hold
    [FUNC] and then press the [TRACK] keys to mute or unmute tracks.
- Digitakt remembers the last used version of MUTE mode and will access this one first
    when you press [FUNC] + [BANK]. This also applies to QUICK MUTE.


## 9. PATTERNS, KITS, SOUNDS, AND SAMPLES

## 9. PATTERNS, KITS, SOUNDS, AND SAMPLES

```
The patterns are the primary data container for the Digitakt. Sixteen patterns are available for each of the
eight banks, which means that 128 patterns are available for each project. A pattern contains up to eight
Sounds (one for each audio track), sequencer data like trigs and parameter locks. It also contains the de-
fault settings on the TRIG page and BPM, length, swing and time signature settings. A pattern also contains
all the parameter settings for the eight MIDI tracks.
A kit is a collection of eight Sounds. A Sound is a sample, plus all the settings in the PARAMETER pages
(SRC, FLTR, AMP, and LFO). A Sound can be assigned to one of the eight audio tracks.
Each of the audio tracks can contain one Sound. A Sound that has been imported from the +Drive to a pat-
tern becomes part of the active pattern. Any changes made to a Sound will therefore not affect the stored
Sound or kit. It will only affect the Sound in the active pattern. You can export (and in that way save) a
Sound from the active pattern to the +Drive. For more information, please see “9.3 SOUND MANAGER” on
page 27.
A sample that is used in a Sound or a pattern can be renamed or moved and still work as intended. This is
due to a hash function that adds a file specific value to every file, and this value is independent of the file
name or the file’s location in the data structure. However, if you delete a sample, it will not be included in any
Sounds or patterns anymore.
```
- When a Sound is imported to a pattern, it becomes a copy of the Sound on the +Drive and
    is not linked to the original Sound stored on the +Drive. Instead, it fully becomes a part of
    the pattern.
- If you delete a sample from the +Drive, it will not be included in any Sounds or patterns
    anymore.

```
A Pattern contains:
```
- A kit.
- All parameter settings for the eight MIDI tracks.
- Sequencer data such as trigs and parameter locks.
- The settings on the TRIG PARAMETERS page, BPM, length, swing and time signature settings.

```
A Kit contains:
```
- Eight audio track Sounds.
- LEVEL settings for the audio tracks.

```
A Sound contains:
```
- A sample (linked from the +Drive), plus the SRC, FLTR, AMP, and LFO PARAMETER pages settings for
    the audio track.
A Sample contains:
- A 16 bit, 48 kHz, mono audio file.

### 9.1 THE +DRIVE SOUND LIBRARY AND THE SOUND POOL

```
The total size of the +Drive is 1 GB. The +Drive Sound library can hold up to 2048 Sounds (256 Sounds in
each bank A-H) that are available to all projects. The +Drive Sound library also contains the samples. You
can load up to 64 MB (about 11 minutes) of samples to a project. A sample must be imported to a projects
Sound Pool, for it to be Sample locked.
Sounds can be loaded to a pattern from either the +Drive Sound library or the Sound pool of the active
project. The difference between the two is that the +Drive Sound library has the capacity of 2048 Sounds,
available to all projects, while the Sound pool is a part of a project and limited to 128 Sounds. The primary
benefit of Sounds loaded to the Sound pool is the possibility for them to be Sound locked. This feature is
not available for the Sounds in the +Drive Sound library. For more information, please see “10.9.2 SOUND
LOCKS” on page 37.

## 10. THE SEQUENCER

## 10. THE SEQUENCER

The sequencer of the Digitakt stores information in patterns. A pattern controls the playback of the audio
tracks, the MIDI tracks and various pattern-specific aspects of the tracks. Each of the eight banks, A to H,
contains 16 patterns, which means 128 patterns are available for each project. For more information, please
see “15.4 PATTERN MENU” on page 67.

A pattern contains:

- General trig settings on the TRIG page (default note pitch, velocity et cetera).
- The parameter settings on the SCR, FLTR, AMP, and LFO pages.
- The settings on the DELAY, REVERB, and MASTER pages.
- Quantization settings.
- Note trigs and Lock trigs for all tracks.
- Parameter/Sample/Sounds locks.
- Length and time signature for the tracks.

### 10.1 BASIC PATTERN OPERATIONS

Digitakt can seamlessly switch between patterns. This, together with the ability to chain patterns, is a handy
feature when improvising live. For more information, please see “10.10 CHAINS” on page 40.

#### 10.1.1 SELECTING BANK AND PATTERN

```
Press [BANK] and then press [TRIG 9–16] to select a bank. Then press [TRIG 1–16] to select a pattern.
Press [PTN] and then press [TRIG 1–16] to select a new pattern in the current bank. When you press
[BANK] or [PTN] you must choose a bank or pattern within four seconds for the change to take effect.
A message on the screen indicates the four second timeout. Press [TRK] to exit pattern or bank select.
White [TRIG] keys indicate pattern positions that contain data. A red [TRIG] key indicates the current
active pattern. Empty patterns are unlit.
When a pattern is playing, and a new pattern is selected, the new pattern position will be shown flashing
in the upper left corner of the screen. Once the last step of the pattern has played, the new pattern will
start, and the pattern position will cease to flash.
```
- Patterns can be changed while the sequencer is running.
- Patterns can be changed and queued by sending program change messages.
- It is possible to copy a pattern, and then paste it to one or several locations without
    leaving the active pattern. You can also clear one or several non-active patterns.
    - To copy, press and hold [PATTERN] + [TRIG] key to select the pattern you wish to
    copy. Then press [RECORD]. Let go of the [TRIG] key and then press and hold the
    [TRIG] key(s) to where you want to paste the pattern. Finally, press and hold [STOP] to
    paste the pattern(s).
    - To clear, press and hold [PATTERN] + [TRIG] key(s) to select the pattern(s) you wish
    to clear. Then press and hold [PLAY] to clear the pattern(s).

#### 10.1.2 PATTERN CONTROL

#### 10.1.3 PATTERN TEMPO

```
The tempo is set in the TEMPO menu. Press [TEMPO] to open this menu. For more information, please
see “7.1.3 TEMPO” on page 21.
```
### 10.2 EDITING A PATTERN

Digitakt offers three main modes of input when creating or editing a pattern, GRID RECORDING mode, LIVE
RECORDING mode, and STEP RECORDING mode. In these modes, two types of trigs can be entered: Note
trigs and Lock trigs.


##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

#### 10.2.1 TRIG TYPES

```
A trig is a sequencer event that you can place when you want the sequencer to perform an action on the
Digitakt. There are two types of trigs that you can use, note trigs and lock trigs.
```
- NOTE TRIGS trigger Sounds or MIDI notes.
- LOCK TRIGS trigger parameter locks (but does not trigger Sounds or MIDI notes). For more informa-
    tion, please see “10.9.1 PARAMETER LOCKS” on page 37.
Note trigs are indicated by red [TRIG] keys and lock trigs are indicated by yellow [TRIG] keys. Unlit
[TRIG] keys indicate steps that does not contain any trigs. Read more about parameter locks in section
“10.9.1 PARAMETER LOCKS” on page 37. Trigs are added differently in the sequencer, depending on
whether GRID RECORDING, LIVE RECORDING, or STEP RECORDING mode is active.

#### 10.2.2 GRID RECORDING MODE

```
GRID RECORDING is a method of composing where you use the [TRIG] keys to add trigs.
```
1. Press [RECORD] to enter GRID RECORDING mode. The [RECORD] key lights up red to indicate
    that GRID RECORDING mode is active.
2. Select the track to which you want to add trigs by pressing and holding [TRACK] and then one of
    the [TRIG] keys. A red [TRIG] key indicates the active track.
3. Place note trigs on the sequencer using the sixteen [TRIG] keys. To add a lock trig, press [FUNC] +
    [TRIG]. Quickly pressing the [TRIG] key of any of the trigs entered will remove the trig. Pressing a
    [TRIG] key of a trig and holding it slightly longer will prepare the trig for editing, rather than remov-
    ing it.
4. Select another track, and add note trigs. Repeat the procedure for all the tracks you want to use.
5. Press [PLAY] to listen to the sequence.
Add micro timing to a note trig by pressing and holding the [TRIG] key while pressing [ARROW] keys
[LEFT] or [RIGHT]. For more information, please see “10.3 MICRO TIMING MENU” on page 34.
Set the retrig speed by pressing and holding the [TRIG] key while pressing [ARROW] keys [UP] or
[DOWN]. Similarly, a pop-up menu will appear on the screen, where various retrig settings are made.
For more information, please see “10.4 RETRIG MENU” on page 34.
If the pattern contains more than 16 steps, select the pattern page you want to edit by pressing the
[PAGE] key. A fully lit <PATTERN PAGE> LED shows the active pattern page.
Press [RECORD] to exit the GRID RECORDING mode.
- You can use an external MIDI controller such as a keyboard to input NOTE and TRIG
VELOCITY data when you are in GRID RECORDING mode Just press and hold a [TRIG]
key, and then play a note on the external keyboard. On MIDI tracks, you can add up to a
four note chord to every trig. The first note sets the TRIG VELOCITY value for all notes
on the trig.
- Press [TRIG] + [YES] to preview a specific trig. The preview includes any parameter
locks you have placed on that trig.
- If you use an external MIDI controller to record to the Digitakt MIDI tracks, the sequenc-
er receives data on the Auto MIDI channel and records on the active track. For more
information, please see “15.5.3 CHANNELS” on page 70.
- All trigs of a track can be shifted forwards or backward on the sequencer. While in GRID
RECORDING mode, hold down [FUNC] while pressing the [LEFT] or [RIGHT] arrow
keys to perform the trig shift.

#### 10.2.3 LIVE RECORDING MODE

```
LIVE RECORDING mode is the second method of adding trigs to the tracks. In this recording mode, the
[TRIG] keys are played in real time to input trigs to the tracks. You can also use CHROMATIC mode to
add note trigs chromatically. It is also possible to enter parameter locks in real time. Trigs input in LIVE
RECORDING mode can be automatically quantized or not. Non-quantized trigs can be quantized after
they are recorded, by using the QUANTIZE menu that is accessed by pressing [FUNC] + [TRIG]. For
more information, please see “10.6 QUANTIZE MENU” on page 35.
```
1. Press and hold [RECORD], then press [PLAY] to enter LIVE RECORDING mode. (Press [PLAY]
    twice while keeping the [RECORD] key pressed to activate/deactivate automatic quantization.) The
    sequencer starts to play, and the [RECORD] key starts to flash red.


##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

2. Enter trigs in real time by tapping the [TRIG] keys. If CHROMATIC mode is active, the pitch value of
    the note trig will be recorded according to which [TRIG] key is pressed. Any changes to PARAM-
    ETER page settings, using the DATA ENTRY knobs, will be recorded as parameter locks and add
    lock trigs where needed.
3. Press [PLAY] to exit LIVE RECORDING mode while keeping the sequencer playing. If LIVE RE-
    CORDING mode is active and [RECORD] is pressed, GRID RECORDING mode will be activated.
4. Press [STOP] to stop both recording and playback of the sequencer.

To exit LIVE RECORDING mode while keeping the sequencer playing, press [PLAY].

```
You can use an external MIDI controller such as a keyboard to input NOTE, TRIG
VELOCITY, and TRIG LENGTH data in LIVE RECORDING mode. Just play the notes on the
external keyboard and they will be recorded by the sequencer. On MIDI tracks, you can
add up to a four note chord to every trig. The first note sets the TRIG VELOCITY value for
all notes on the trig. The last note that is released sets the TRIG LENGTH for all notes on
the trig.
```
#### 10.2.4 STEP RECORDING MODE.

STEP RECORDING is a quick and straightforward method of placing trigs on the sequencer. In this re-
cording mode, you insert notes by pressing the [TRIG] keys or an external MIDI controller. The sequenc-
er then captures the note and automatically advances to the next step. There are two different modes
available, STANDARD mode and JUMP mode.

STANDARD mode

1. Press [RECORD] + [STOP] to enter STEP RECORDING mode. The [RECORD] key starts to
    double-blink red. (Press [STOP] twice while keeping the [RECORD] key pressed to toggle between
    STANDARD and JUMP mode).
2. Press a [TRIG] key to select the active step to where you want to start to add note trigs. The active
    step is shown with a green [TRIG] key that double-blinks. (If positioned on an earlier placed trig, it
    inherits the light pattern of that trig). You can also use [LEFT]/[RIGHT] to select the active step or
    skip steps.
3. Press and hold [FUNC] and then press [TRIG 1–16] key to add a note trig on the corresponding
    track to the active step. The active step then automatically advances to the next step.

```
You also have the option to add note trigs chromatically on the selected active track.
```
4. Press [TRK] + [TRIG 1–16] to select the track to which you want to add trigs. A red [TRIG] key
    indicates the active track.
5. Press [FUNC] + [TRK] to toggle the chromatic mode keyboard on
6. Press and hold [FUNC] and then press any lit [TRIG] key to add a note trig with the corresponding
    note value to the selected step. The active step then automatically advances to the next step. You
    can use [UP]/[DOWN] to transpose the chromatic keyboard on the [TRIG] keys up or down in
    octaves.
7. To remove a trig or to add a rest (no trig), position the active step on the trig that you want to
    remove or add a rest to, and then press [NO]. The active step then automatically advances to the
    next step.
8. To add a parameter lock to a trig, press and hold a [TRIG] key, and then turn the DATA ENTRY
    knob that controls the parameter you want to lock and set it to the desired value. The graphics
    become inverted for the locked parameter, and the locked parameter value is displayed. The [TRIG]
    key of the locked trig blinks red (for note trigs) or yellow (for lock trigs) to indicate that the trig now
    contains a parameter lock.
9. Press [RECORD] to exit STEP RECORDING mode.

JUMP mode

In JUMP mode, the LEN parameter setting on the TRIG PARAMETER page controls the note length of
the trigs you place, and advances the active step the same length. A LEN value of 1/16 adds a sixteenth
note and advances the sequencer one step. 1/8 adds an eighth note and advances the sequencer two
steps. 1/4 adds a quarter note and advances the sequencer four steps and so on. The LEN parameter is
also parameter locked on every trig you place.


##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

- Press [PLAY] to listen to the sequence while you are programming it. Press [STOP] to
    stop the sequencer and stay in STEP RECORDING mode.
- If you use an external MIDI controller, you must set it to send MIDI data on the Digitakt’s
    defined AUTO CHANNEL. For more information, please see “15.5.3 CHANNELS” on
    page 70.
- If you use an external MIDI controller, the trig’s VEL (velocity) value is determined by the
    velocity sent from these and is parameter locked.
- If you press and hold [FUNC] while inputting notes from an external MIDI controller, the
    velocity is fixed and determined by the VEL parameter setting.
- If you press and hold [YES] while you place a trig with [TRIG] keys or an external MIDI
    controller, the trig length is locked to the time you press the [TRIG] keys or the external
    MIDI controller.
- If you add a new note trig on a previously placed note trig, any parameter locks previ-
    ously placed on that trig remain as they were.
- In STEP RECORDING mode, to avoid accidental key presses, [FUNC] + [NO] does not
    reload the pattern. [FUNC] + [YES] does not save the pattern. Instead they work as
    described above.

### 10.3 MICRO TIMING MENU

```
Here you can add micro timing to a note trig, moving it ahead or behind the beat. Micro timing can be cus-
tomized on any of the sequencer steps on both audio and MIDI tracks. In GRID RECORDING mode, press
and hold one or several [TRIG] keys and then press [LEFT]/[RIGHT] to access the pop-up Micro timing
menu that shows the time offset for the chosen sequencer step(s) on the active track. To exit the micro
timing menu, release the [TRIG] key(s). The micro timing settings are stored in the active pattern
```
```
MICRO TIMING Press [LEFT]/[RIGHT keys to adjust the time offset.
```
### 10.4 RETRIG MENU

```
Retrigs can be customized on any of the sequencer steps on the audio tracks (the retrig function is not
available on the MIDI tracks). In GRID RECORDING mode, press and hold one or several [TRIG] keys and
then press [UP]/[DOWN] to access the pop-up Retrig menu that shows the retrig actions for the chosen
sequencer step(s) on the active track. To exit the Retrig menu, release the [TRIG] key(s). The retrig settings
are stored in the active pattern.
```
```
RETRIG Turns the retrig lock ON/OFF. Use DATA ENTRY knob A to turn retrig on/off.
R AT E Sets the retrig rate (1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/8, 1/10, 1/12, 1/16, 1/20, 1/24, 1/32, 1/40, 1/48, 1/64
or 1/80). 1/16 is the nominal retrig rate, one trig per step. 1/32 corresponds to two trigs per step and so
on. To trig triplets, for example, set the retrig rate to 1/12 (or 1/24). You can also press the [UP]/[DOWN]
keys when you are in the retrig menu to adjust the rate.
```

##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

```
LEN Sets the duration of the retrig velocity curve in fractions of, or rational or integer multiples of, a step
(0,125–INF). 1/16 is the nominal length of one step. This setting affects the behavior of the velocity curve
by defining the boundaries of its envelope.
VEL Sets the velocity curve fade out/fade in of the retrig (-128–127). -128 corresponds to a complete
fade out during the set length, -64 fades out to half the velocity during the set length, 0 equals a flat
velocity curve with no fade, 64 fades into half velocity during the set length and 127 fades in completely
to full velocity during the set length.
```
### 10.5 TRIG PARAMETERS PAGE

Set the actions for when a note is trigged in the TRIG PARAMETERS page. Press the [TRIG PARAME-
TERS] key to access the menu. Change settings using the DATA ENTRY knobs. These general settings
affect note trigs placed on the sequencer. On any step of the pattern, trigs can be locked to other settings
by first pressing and holding a [TRIG] key, then changing the settings. For more information, please see
“11.2 TRIG PARAMETERS PAGE” on page 43.

### 10.6 QUANTIZE MENU

```
The quantization affects all micro timed and off grid trigs on the sequencers tracks. Press [FUNC] +
[TRIG PARAMETERS] to access this menu. Change settings with DATA ENTRY knob E and F.
```
```
TRK. affects all the trigs of the active track in real time. The higher the quantize value, the more the
trigs will be quantized. Press [TRIG 1–8] key to select track to quantize. (0–127)
GLOBAL affects all the trigs of all tracks in real time. The higher the quantize value, the more the trigs
will be quantized. (0–127)
Press [NO] to exit the menu.
```
### 10.7 METRONOME MENU

The METRONOME menu controls the internal metronome of the Digitakt. Press [FUNCTION] + [PTN] to
open the METRONOME menu. Use the DATA ENTRY knobs to change the settings.

```
ACTIVE activates/deactivates the metronome. You can also press [FUNC] + [PTN] and hold for a sec-
ond to toggle the metronome on and off when you are not in the METRONOME menu.
TIME SIG. controls the note and beat measure of the metronome time signature.
PREROLL BARS controls for how many bars the metronome will sound before the sequencer starts
playing. This setting is only relevant when you are in LIVE RECORDING mode.
VOL. controls the volume of the click.
```
### 10.8 SCALE MENU

You can set the length and timing of the pattern and tracks in this menu. The SCALE menu has two modes.
In PER PATTERN mode all tracks share the same length. In PER TRACK mode, each track can have differ-
ent lengths. Press [FUNC] + [PAGE] to access the SCALE menu. Press [FUNC] + [YES] to toggle between
the two SCALE modes. Use the DATA ENTRY knobs to adjust the settings.


##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

#### 10.8.1 PER PATTERN MODE

```
In this mode, all tracks of the pattern share the same length and time signature.
```
```
LENGTH controls the step length of the pattern. The leftmost number displays the number of steps
in the pattern. The total length, displayed by the second number, determines the maximum number of
steps available in the pattern. If you use 17 steps or more in a pattern, the [PAGE] key is (while in GRID
RECORDING mode) used to toggle between the different pattern pages.
SCALE controls the speed of pattern playback in multiples of the current tempo. It offers seven pos-
sible settings, 1/8X, 1/4X, 1/2X, 3/4X, 1X, 3/2X and 2X. A setting of 1/8X plays back the pattern at one-
eighth of the set tempo. 3/4X plays the pattern back at three-quarters of the tempo; 3/2X plays back
the pattern twice as fast as the 3/4X setting. 2X makes the pattern play at twice the BPM.
When you extend the length of a pattern, its trigs copies automatically over to the new steps. If a pattern
consists of for example two pages and the pattern length is increased to four pages, the two additional
pattern pages are then copies of the first two pattern pages.
Press the [PAGE] key to change the total length of the pattern quickly. Press the [TRIG] keys to change
the number of steps of the pattern quickly.
A 2X scale setting is useful for increasing the base resolution of the step sequencer to 32nd notes. A
3/4X setting is useful when Digitakt is playing alongside other instruments set to the same BPM, and you
want Digitakt to play triplets.
```
#### 10.8.2 PER TRACK MODE

```
In this mode, you can assign individual length and scale to the tracks of the pattern. Press [FUNC] +
[YES] to switch between the two scale modes. In PER TRACK mode, two columns exist, TRACK and
PATTERN.
```
```
The TRACK column sets the step length and scale of the track. The settings only affects the active track.
Press the [TRK] keys to select the track whose scale settings you wish to edit.
The PATTERN column sets the master change length and the master length of the pattern.
LENGTH controls the step length of the track. The leftmost number displays the number of steps
of the track. The total length, displayed by the second number, determines the maximum number of
steps available for the track. If you use 17 steps or more in a track, the [PAGE] key is (while in GRID
RECORDING mode) used to toggle between the different pattern pages.
SCALE controls the speed of track playback in multiples of the current tempo. It offers seven possible
settings, 1/8X, 1/4X, 1/2X, 3/4X, 1X, 3/2X and 2X. A setting of 1/8X plays back the track at one-eighth
of the set tempo. 3/4X plays the track back at three-quarters of the tempo; 3/2X plays back the track
twice as fast as the 3/4X setting. 2X makes the track play at twice the BPM.
CH.LEN (Change Length) controls for how long the active pattern plays before a cued or chained
pattern begins to play. This setting is important when, for example, you set M.LEN to INF. If you do not
make any CH.LEN setting, the pattern plays infinitely, and the next pattern is thus not cued. By default
a cued pattern change happens at the end of the pattern (CH.LEN set to OFF).
M.LEN (Master Length) controls the number of steps the pattern plays before all tracks restart. An
INF setting makes the tracks of the pattern loop infinitely, without ever being restarted. Note that this
```

##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

```
setting also affects for how long the active pattern plays before a chained pattern starts playing. The
CH.LEN parameter overrides this if its parameter value is less than the M.LEN value.
```
```
In the SCALE menu, you can press [FUNC] + [UP]/[DOWN] to set the TRACK LENGTH in
increments from 2/16 to 64/64.
```
### 10.9 SEQUENCER FEATURES

#### 10.9.1 PARAMETER LOCKS

```
Parameter locks makes it possible to set every trig to have its own unique parameter values. The note
trigs of an audio track can, for example, have different pitch, amp or filter settings. It is possible to pa-
rameter lock the parameters found on the PARAMETER pages, and you can apply parameter locks to
all types of tracks. For a complete overview of all parameters on the PARAMETER pages, please see “11.
AUDIO TRACK PARAMETERS” on page 43, and “12. MIDI TRACK PARAMETERS” on page 50.
Adding parameter locks in GRID RECORDING mode.
```
1. Press [RECORD] to enter GRID RECORDING mode.
2. Press [TRIG] to add a Note trig or [FUNC] + [TRIG] key to add a Lock trig and to where you want
    to perform a parameter lock.
3. Press and hold the [TRIG] key of a previously placed trig (note trig or a lock trig).
4. Turn the DATA ENTRY knobs that control the parameter you want to lock, and set it to the desired
    value. The graphics become inverted for the locked parameter, and the locked parameter value is
    displayed. The [TRIG] key of the locked trig blinks red (for note trigs) or yellow (for lock trigs) to
    indicate the trig now contains a parameter lock.
Remove a single parameter lock by holding [TRIG] + pressing the DATA ENTRY knob of the locked pa-
rameter. You can erase all parameter locks from a trig if you remove the note trig and then enter it again.
Adding parameter locks in LIVE RECORDING mode.
1. Press and hold [RECORD], then press [PLAY] to enter LIVE RECORDING mode.
2. Turn a DATA ENTRY knob, or play the [TRIG] keys in CHROMATIC mode, to add parameter locks
to the active track. Note trigs are placed, and parameter locked accordingly, and it also places lock
trigs that contains the parameter locks on the sequencer steps that do not already have any trigs.
Press [NO] + one (or several) of the [TRIG] keys to erase a sequence of recorded trigs on a specific
track (or on several tracks) in time with the sequencer, i.e. all steps reached on the pattern playing will be
erased until the keys are released.
You can also remove specific parameter locks on a track in real time. In LIVE RECORDING mode, press
and hold [NO] and then press and hold the DATA ENTRY knob corresponding to the parameter that you
want to remove.
Adding parameter locks in STEP RECORDING mode.
1. Press and hold [RECORD], then press [STOP] to enter STEP RECORDING mode.
2. Press and hold a [TRIG] key, and then turn the DATA ENTRY knobs that control the parameter you
want to lock, and set it to the desired value. The graphics become inverted for the locked parame-
ter, and the locked parameter value is displayed. The [TRIG] key of a locked trig blinks red (for note
trigs) or yellow (for lock trigs) to indicate that the trig contains a parameter lock.

```
Up to 72 different parameters can be locked in a pattern. A parameter counts as one (1)
locked parameter no matter how many trigs that lock it. If for example the cutoff parame-
ter of the filter is locked on every sequencer step, there are still 71 other parameters that
can be locked.
```
#### 10.9.2 SOUND LOCKS

```
You can change a tracks Sound to another Sound from the Sound pool on any individual sequencer
step. These Sound locks are an immensely useful feature for adding variations to a track. Press and
hold a note trig and turn the LEVEL/DATA knob to open the Sound pool list. Use the LEVEL/DATA
knob to scroll through the list. Select the Sound you want to assign to the note trig and then release the
[TRIG] key. The [TRIG] key starts to flash to indicate that it contains a Sound lock. Press and hold the
[TRIG] key of the note trig to show the assigned Sound. For more information, please see “9.1.1 ADDING
SOUNDS TO THE SOUND POOL” on page 26.
```

##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

#### 10.9.3 TRIG CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONAL LOCKS

```
Trig conditions are a set of conditional rules that you can apply to any trig, using specific parameter locks
called conditional locks. Each rule is a logical condition that determines whether a trig set on a track in
the sequencer is triggered or not. If the condition is true, then the trig becomes active and affect the
track. If the condition is false, the trig is ignored.
ADDING A CONDITIONAL LOCK
```
1. In GRID RECORDING or STEP RECORDING mode, place a note trig or lock trig on the sequencer
    step to where you want to apply a conditional lock.
2. Press and hold the trig to access the COND (Trig Condition) parameter on the TRIG PARAMETERS
    page. It temporarily replaces the PROB parameter. For more information, please see “11.2 TRIG
    PARAMETERS PAGE” on page 43.
3. Turn DATA ENTRY knob D to select one of the following trig conditions:

```
FILL is true (activates the trig) when FILL mode is active.
FILL is true when FILL is false. A trig with this trig condition is active when you are not in FILL mode.
PRE is true if the most recently evaluated trig condition on the same track was true. (PRE and PRE
conditions are ignored and not evaluated.)
PRE is true when PRE is false. A trig with this trig condition is active if the most recently evaluated trig
condition on the same track was not true. (PRE and PRE conditions are ignored and not evaluated.)
Example 1: Trig 1, 50% = True > Trig 2, PRE = False > Trig 3, PRE = False > Trig 4, PRE = True
Example 2: Trig 1, 50% = False > Trig 2, PRE = True > Trig 3, PRE = True > Trig 4, PRE = False
NEI is true if the most recently evaluated trig condition on the neighbor track was true. (PRE and PRE
conditions on the neighbor track are ignored and not evaluated.) The neighbor track is the track
before the active track. For example, track 3 is the neighbor track of track 4. NEI and NEI conditional
trigs on track 4 evaluate the conditional trigs placed on track 3. The NEI condition is false if no condi-
tional trigs exist on the neighbor track.
NEI is true when NEI is false. A trig with this trig condition is active if the most recently evaluated trig
condition on the neighbor track was not true. (PRE and PRE conditions on the neighbor track are
ignored and not evaluated.)
1ST is true the first time the pattern plays (when looped).
1ST is true when 1ST is false. A trig with this trig condition is always active apart from the first time the
pattern plays (when looped).
X% is a probability condition. There is an x% chance that the trig will be active.
A:B A sets how many times the pattern (or track, if the track length is shorter than the pattern length)
plays before the trig condition is true. B sets how many times the pattern (or track, if the track length
is shorter than the pattern length) plays before the count is reset and starts over again. This cycle
then repeats until you stop the sequencer.
For example:
With the setting 1:2, the trig condition is true the first time the pattern plays and then the third, the fifth,
and so on.
With the setting 2:2, the trig condition is true the second time the pattern plays and then the fourth,
the sixth, and so on.
With the setting 2:4, the trig condition is true the second time the pattern plays and then the sixth, the
tenth, and so on.
With the setting 4:7 the trig condition is true the fourth time the pattern plays and then the eleventh,
the eighteenth, and so on.
```
- The sequencer needs to be in FILL mode to activate the conditional lock called FILL.
    For more information, please see “10.9.4 FILL MODE” on page 39.
- Conditional parameter locks are a great way to add variety to a pattern. To set up a grid
    of mutually exclusive or conclusive note trigs across any of the audio tracks, and adding
    some probability locks in there as well (perhaps, in turn, also sporting an array of logi-
    cally conditioned trigs), is a neat way to make the most minimal of compositions come
    alive with randomness.
- Note that random or arbitrary variety, while fun and interesting, is not the only way of us-
    ing conditional trigs. They may also be used, for example, to have two different melodic
    or percussive sequences on the same track, one of which is activated only when FILL
    mode is active.


##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

#### 10.9.4 FILL MODE

FILL mode can be used to create a temporary variation, such as a drum fill, in your pattern.

Press [YES] + [PAGE] to activate FILL mode for one pattern cycle. It will become active when the pat-
tern loops, and remain active until it loops again. You can also activate FILL mode at any time, and for any
duration, by pressing and holding the [PAGE] key when the pattern is playing (GRID RECORDING mode
cannot be active). The FILL mode is active for as long as the key is held.

Press and hold [PAGE] + [YES], and then release [PAGE] before you release [YES] to latch FILL mode.
Press [PAGE] again to unlatch FILL mode.

#### 10.9.5 SWING

Adjust the swing setting of the pattern, to employ a propulsive, rhythmic groove. Press [TEMPO] to
access this menu.

Turn DATA ENTRY knob E to set the SWING ratio to 51-80%. The default setting is equal spacing, 50%.

#### 10.9.6 COPY, PASTE AND CLEAR OPERATIONS

Patterns, tracks, track pages, and trigs can be copied, pasted and cleared.

The active pattern can be copied to another location in the same bank or in another bank. To perform
a pattern copy operation, GRID RECORDING mode must be deactivated. Copy the pattern by pressing
[FUNC] + [RECORD]. Select another pattern, and then press [FUNC] + [STOP] to paste the copied
pattern to this location. Press [FUNC] + [PLAY] to clear all the trigs in the current pattern.

Individual sequencer tracks can be copied, pasted and cleared in the same way as patterns. To do so,
GRID RECORDING mode must be active.

A single track page may also be copied, pasted and cleared. It is similar to copying/pasting/clearing a
track, but will only affect the active track page. Select the track page of choice by pressing the [PAGE]
key. Copy by pressing [PAGE] + [RECORD]. Select a new track page and press [PAGE] + [STOP] to
paste. Press [PAGE] + [PLAY] to clear the active track page.

Trigs, complete with all parameter lock settings, can be copied, pasted and cleared as well. GRID
RECORDING mode needs to be active to access this functionality. Press and hold a trig and press
[RECORD] to perform the copy operation. Paste by holding another [TRIG] key and pressing [STOP].
It is also possible to copy more than one trig. Press and hold the trigs you wish to copy, and then press
[RECORD]. Press and hold the [TRIG] key to where you want to paste, and then press [STOP] to paste
the copied sequence of trigs. When pasting, the copied trigs are placed in the same relation to each
other as they had when they were copied. The destination trig acts as the starting point for the sequence
of copied trigs. Clear trig locks by holding one or more trigs and press [PLAY].

You can undo any copy, paste, and clear operation by repeating the key presses.

```
It is possible to copy, clear and paste one or several patterns without leaving the active
pattern. To copy, press and hold [PTN] + [TRIG] key to select the pattern you wish to copy.
Then press [RECORD]. Let go of the [TRIG] key and then press and hold the [TRIG] key(s)
to where you want to paste the pattern. Finally, press and hold [STOP] until the count down
finishes to paste the pattern(s). To clear, press and hold [PTN] + [TRIG] key(s) to select
the pattern(s) you wish to clear. Then press and hold [PLAY] to clear the pattern(s).
```
#### 10.9.7 TEMPORARY SAVE AND RELOAD PATTERN COMMANDS

Patterns can instantly be saved to a temporary memory space and then reloaded again from this space.

- To perform a temporary save of the active pattern, press [FUNC] + [YES]. This is useful in order to
    create a restore point when you are live tweaking, but without permanently save your changes.
- To perform a temporary reload of the active pattern, press [FUNC] + [NO]. It will the reload the pat-
    tern from when you last used the temporary save command. If you have not done any temporary save,
    then the pattern will reload from the permanently saved state.


##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

```
The TEMPORARY SAVE PATTERN and TEMPORARY RELOAD PATTERN commands are
great when improvising live. Any changes made to the active pattern, like adding bass line
notes or using CONTROL ALL , can immediately be undone. And at the same time, the
saves and reloads will not affect the pattern in a permanent way.
```
```
The TEMPORARY SAVE PATTERN command will not save the pattern permanently and
any changes will be lost if you load another project. If you wish to save your changes per-
manently, you should use SAVE TO PROJ in the PATTERN MENU. For more information,
please see “15.4 PATTERN MENU” on page 67.
```
### 10.10 CHAINS

```
Chains are sequences that consist of more than one pattern. You can use chains to preselect and automate
in what order you want your patterns to play.
```
```
You can create one chain and it can contain any pattern in bank A–H. The chain can consist of up to 64
patterns.
```
1. Press [BANK] + [TRIG 9–16] key to select bank.
2. Press and hold [PTN] and then press a [TRIG 1–16] key to select the first pattern in the chain.
3. Release the [PTN] key and then press [TRIG 1–16] keys in the same order as you want the chained
    patterns to play. Keep a previous [TRIG] key pressed while you press the next one, the one after that
    and so on. You can press the same [TRIG] key again if you wish to add the pattern multiple times in a
    row. If you want to add a pattern from another bank, press [BANK] + [TRIG 9–16] to select bank, and
    then press [TRIG 1–16] to select pattern.
4. Press [PLAY] to start the sequencer and play the chain. The chain will be looped once the final pat-
    tern of the chain has played.

```
Please note that the chain will be lost when you create a new chain or when you select a new
bank/pattern. Chains cannot be saved and will be lost when you switch the Digitakt off.
```
- Chains can be created while the sequencer is running.
- You can also use MIDI program change messages from an external device to change
    patterns on the Digitakt. For more information, please see “15.5.1 SYNC” on page 68.

### 10.11 SONG MODE

```
A song is an arrangement of patterns set up to play in sequence. Each row in the SONG mode arrangement
can have separate settings for pattern, row repeat, row length, tempo, and mute. A song can be up to 99
rows in length, and each project can contain up to 16 songs.
```
#### 10.11.1 THE SONG EDIT SCREEN

5. ROW LENGTH (measured in sequencer steps). This setting defines how many steps the sequenc-
    er plays from the selected pattern. The default value is the same as the pattern length. (Range:
    2–1024, the last 25 values are written as K00–K24)
6. ROW TEMPO Here, you set the row’s BPM per row. You can also choose to have one BPM for the
    whole song. By default, the row inherits the BPM and swing set in the pattern selected for the row.
    Press [TEMPO] to open the TEMPO menu for the currently selected row’s pattern. Here you can
    also set the swing. You can also press [YES] while highlighting the BPM parameter to open the
    TEMPO menu. Selecting song tempo on any row overrides all the previously set row and pattern
    tempos. The swing settings are always set per row.
7. SONG POINTER Shows the current time and position of the playhead in the song arrangement.
8. ROW MUTE lets you mute the tracks of the pattern on the selected row. Highlight and press [YES]
    to edit. A mute icon is displayed in the rows that have tracks that are muted. Use the [TRIG] keys
    to mute and unmute the tracks. When selecting a pattern for the row, the row’s mute state initially
    reflects the pattern’s mute state
9. END row. This row is always added at the end of a song and determines what will happen when the
    song has played the last song row. By default, it is set to LOOP the song from the beginning and
    play it again, but it can also be set to STOP the song.
10. The currently selected row is highlighted between dotted lines. Use [UP] and [DOWN] to select row.
11. PLAYHEAD position shows the row currently playing (or set to play if the sequencer is stopped).
12. SONG SLOT and SONG NAME.

## 11. AUDIO TRACK PARAMETERS

## 11. AUDIO TRACK PARAMETERS

Here follows a description of all of the parameters that are available on the audio tracks PARAMETER pag-
es. The parameters on the TRIG page are not saved together with the Sound, but are instead saved with
the pattern. The audio track parameters may be locked to other settings on any step of the pattern by first
pressing and holding a [TRIG] key, then changing the parameters’ settings with the DATA ENTRY knobs.
For more information, please see “10.9.1 PARAMETER LOCKS” on page 37.

### 11.1 EDITING THE AUDIO TRACK PARAMETERS

There are five PARAMETER pages for the audio tracks. Press the [PARAMETER] keys to access the audio
tracks PARAMETER pages. The SRC parameter group has two pages To access page one, press the [SRC]
key once. To access page two, press the [SRC] key twice. Use the DATA ENTRY knobs A-H to change the
parameters. Press and hold a [PARAMETER] key to see the values for all parameters on that page.

- You can always reload a Sound from its last saved state. Press [TRK] + [TRIG1–8] + [NO]
    to reload the Sound.
- You can also randomize the parameter settings on a specific PARAMETER page on an
    audio track. Press [PARAMETER] key + [YES] to randomize all parameters on that page.
    Every time you press this key combination, the parameters randomize in a new way.
- Press [PARAMETER] key + [NO] to reset the PARAMETER page to its last saved state.

### 11.2 TRIG PARAMETERS PAGE

Set the actions for when a note is trigged. Change settings using the DATA ENTRY knobs. These general
settings affect note trigs placed in the sequencer.

Press [TRIG PARAMETERS] to access this parameter page.

##### 11.2.1 NOTE

```
Trig Note sets the pitch of the note when trigged. When in LIVE RECORDING mode and playing in
CHROMATIC mode, the pitch of the [TRIG] keys played will override this setting. (-48–+24)
```
```
11.2.2 VEL
Trig Velocity sets the velocity of the sequencer’s note trigs. (0–127)
```
```
11.2.3 LEN
Trig Length sets the length of the note trig. In LIVE RECORDING mode, the duration of pressing the
[TRIG] keys overrides this general setting. (0–127, INF)
```
```
11.2.4 PROB
Trig Probability sets the probability that the trigs on the track plays or not. The probability outcome is
re-evaluated every time a trig is set to play. The default setting is 100%, meaning that all the trigs on the
track plays every time. (0%–100%)
This parameter changes temporarily to display and control COND (Trig Condition) when you add a condi-
tional lock. COND sets the Trig Condition with which a set of conditional rules can be applied to any trig,
using a parameter lock. For more information, please see “10.9.3 TRIG CONDITIONS AND CONDITION-
AL LOCKS” on page 38.
```
```
If you have placed a conditional lock on a trig in the sequencer, the trig condition overrides
the Trig Probability setting. For example, if you set PROB to 70% and a FILL trig condition
on a trig, that trig will only (and always) play when the Digitakt is in FILL mode. For more
information, please see “10.9.3 TRIG CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONAL LOCKS” on page
38.
```

##### 11. AUDIO TRACK PARAMETERS

```
```
11.6.2 HOLD
Hold Time sets the length of the hold phase of the amp envelope. Fixed Hold time values (0–126) specify
the length of the hold phase, and the envelope ignores Note Off events such as Trig Length (See “10.5
TRIG PARAMETERS PAGE” on page 35), releasing a [TRIG] key or a key on an external controller.
Setting HOLD to NOTE means the hold phase will be determined by Note On and Note Off events.
(0–126, NOTE)
```
```
If you set HOLD to NOTE and use an external keyboard to trigger the envelope, then the
sound will be sustained for as long as you press a key on the keyboard (or until the sample

```
```
11.7.7 MODE
Trig Mode sets how the LFO will act when a note is trigged.
```
- FRE is the default free-running mode. It makes the LFO run continuously, never restarting or
stopping even if notes are trigged..
- TRG makes the LFO restart when a note is trigged.
- HLD makes the LFO run free in the background, but when a note is trigged the LFO output level is
latched and held still until the next note is trigged.
- ONE The LFO starts when a note is trigged, then runs to the end of the waveform and then stops.
This makes the LFO function similar to an envelope.
- HLF The LFO starts when a note is trigged, then runs to the middle of the waveform and then stops.

```
11.7.8 DEP
Depth sets the depth and polarity of the LFO modulation. Both negative (inverted) and positive modula-

## 13. FX AND MIXER PARAMETERS

```
The Digitakt effects and mixers parameters are explained in this chapter.
```
```
The parameters on the FX and mixer pages can be set to work on a global level making them
affect all patterns in the project instead of just the currently selected pattern. This function-
ality is useful when you want to adjust the settings of multiple patterns and at the same time
assure that these settings are the same for all the patterns in the project. For more informa-
tion, please see “15.8 GLOBAL FX/MIX” on page 72.
```
### 13.1 EDITING THE FX PARAMETERS

```

```
Ping-pong sets the delay signal to alternate across the stereo field. There are two settings:
```
- OFF lets you manually set the position of the delay signal in the stereo field. Use the WID parameter
to change the stereo field position.
- ON makes the delay signal alternate between left and right pan positions. The WID parameter
controls the amount of panning.

```
13.2.3 WID
Stereo Width sets the delay signal pan width across the stereo field. The knob is bipolar. (-64.00–63.00)
```
```
13.2.4 FDBK
Feedback Gain sets the amount of delay output signal to feed back into the input of the delay. With high-
er parameter settings, infinite and/or swelling delays are possible. Please be aware that high feedback
can lead to a very loud signal. (0–198)
```
```
13.2.5 HPF
Feedback HPF sets the cutoff frequency of the delay highpass filter. (0.00–127.00)
```
```

It can simulate many different sonic locations, from huge spaces to small rooms.

Press [FUNC] + [AMP] to access this parameter page.

##### 13.3.1 PRE

```
Pre-delay sets the pre-delay time of the Reverb. (0.00–127.00)
```
```
13.3.2 DEC
Decay Time sets the length of the decay phase of the reverberated signal, essentially setting the size of
the acoustic space. (1–127, INF)
```

##### 13. FX AND MIXER PARAMETERS

##### 13.3.3 FREQ

```
FB Shelving Freq sets the shelving filter frequency. Together with the GAIN parameter, it can be used to
dampen the reverberated signal above a chosen frequency, making the reverberation sound more promi-
nent or more muffled. (0.00–127.00)
```
```
13.3.4 GAIN
FB Shelving Gain affects the damping of the reverberated signal above the shelving frequency set by the
FREQ parameter. At max value the treble is included in the reverberations; lowering the value gradually
dampens it. (0.00–127.00)
```
```
13.3.5 HPF
HPF sets the cutoff frequency of the reverb high-pass filter that affects the audio going in to the reverb.
(0.00–127.00)
```
```
13.3.6 LPF
LPF sets the cutoff frequency of the reverb low-pass filter that affects the audio going in to the reverb.
(0.00–127.00)
```
```
13.3.6 REV
Rev Pre/Post Comp sets whether the signal from the reverb should enter the audio chain before or after
the compressor. (PRE, POST) For more information, please see “4.2 EFFECTS” on page 15.
```
```
13.3.7 VOL
Mix Volume sets the volume of the Reverb output signal. (0.00–127.00)
```
### 13.4 COMPRESSOR (MASTER PAGE 1)

```
The Compressor master effect compresses the dynamic range of the signal by reducing the volume
of loud sounds relative to the quiet sounds. There are eight parameters with which the compressor is
customized on this page. There is a bar on the rightmost edge of the screen that visually represents the
amount of compression.
Press [FUNC] + [LFO] once to access this parameter page.
```
##### 13.4.1 THR

```
Threshold sets the threshold of the compressor. A lower threshold means a larger portion of the signal
are subject to compression. (0–127)
```
```
13.4.2 ATK
Attack sets the time of the compressor attack phase, i.e. how quickly the compressor responds to loud
peaks. (0–127)
```
```
13.4.3 REL
Release sets the time of the compressor release phase, i.e. how long it takes for the compression to
recover in quieter moments. (0–127)
```
```
13.4.4 MUP
Makeup Gain sets the makeup gain of the compressor output, to compensate for the reduced signal
levels caused by compression. The Makeup Gain parameter value is displayed in dB. (0.0–24.0)
```
```
13.4.5 VOL
Pattern volume sets the patterns overall audio level. This parameter basically has the same function as
the MASTER VOLUME knob, but is saved together with the pattern. (0–127)
```

##### 13. FX AND MIXER PARAMETERS

##### 13.4.6 RAT

```
Compression Ratio. There are eight different compression ratios, 1.50, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00, 6.00, 8.00, 16.00
and 20.00. Higher ratios result in greater compression of the signal.
```
```
13.4.7 SCS
Sidechain Source decides what audio source the compressor analyzes when it performs sidechaining.
Sidechaining is the process when the compressor uses the output of an audio source to control the
overall action of the compressor. For example, if you set SCS to TRK1 where you have a kick drum, every
time the kick drum plays, the compressor lowers the overall sound of the mix.
MAIN sets the sidechain source to be the sound sent to the Main (L/R) outputs.
TRK1–8 sets the sidechain source to be the sound sent from one of the separate audio tracks.
IN L sets the sidechain source to be the sound coming from INPUT L.
IN R sets the sidechain source to be the sound coming from INPUT R.
```
```
13.4.8 SCF
Sidechain Filter filters the signal from the sidechain source before the compressor analyzes it. The
parameter ranges from a low-pass filter to a high-pass filter. Negative parameter values sets a low-pass
filer. Positive parameter values sets a high-pass filter. (-64–63)
When set as a low-pass filter, the compressor reacts mostly to bass frequencies. Use this setting for a
characteristic pumping compressor sound. When set as a high-pass filter, the compressor reacts less to
bass frequencies. Use this setting to avoid pumping.
```
```
13.4.9 DRY/WET MIX
Dry/Wet Mix sets the mix of the uncompressed signal and the compressor output signal. A setting of
0 results in a completely uncompressed signal. A setting of 127 lets only the compressed signal pass
through. All values in between mix the uncompressed signal with the compressed signal, which is known
as parallel compression. (0–127)

Setting this parameter to OFF changes the rest of the parameters from being separate controls for the
left and right channel to single controls for both audio channels. The PAN parameters changes to a BAL
(Balance) parameter. Use LEVEL/DATA to adjust this parameter (OFF, ON)
```
```
13.6.6 LDEL
Input L Delay Send sets the amount of sound from the INPUT L audio input that is sent through to the
delay effect. For more information, please see “13.3 DELAY” on page 60. (0.00–127.00)
```
```
13.6.7 RDEL

    an audio track to activate the effects for the External in mixer.


## 14. SAMPLING

## 14. SAMPLING

Digitakt is a very competent and accessible sampler. It can sample audio from external sources via the
external inputs, and it can also sample audio internally from the Digitakt itself. The maximum sampling time
is 33 seconds and this is always available even if a project’s 64 MB of RAM memory is all used up.

### 14.1 SAMPLING MENU.

The SAMPLING menu offers settings that control the different aspects of sampling.

Press [SAMPLING] to access this menu. Use the DATA ENTRY knobs to change the parameters.

#### 14.1.1 REC

```
Press [FUNC] + [YES] to start sampling. Press [YES] to stop sampling.
```
#### 14.1.2 ARM

```
Press [YES] to arm the sampler. The sampler is now in arm mode and it will start sampling when the
incoming audio exceeds the threshold level. See THR below. Press [SAMPLING] + [NO] to cancel.
```
#### 14.1.3 RLEN

```
Record Length sets the length of the sampling. With a setting of 1–128 steps, the sampling length is
decided by the time that it takes the sequencer to advance the set number of steps at the current BPM.
With the MAX setting, the sampling continues until max sampling time (33 seconds) is reached or until
you press [YES] to stop sampling.
```
```
With a BPM set lower than 60, recording the complete 128 steps is not possible because
it will take longer than the maximum sampling time. If the device cannot record the entire
set length, this is shown by two exclamation marks next to the sample memory time on the
screen.
```
#### 14.1.3 THR.

```
If you have selected to arm the sampler, the sampling begins when the incoming audio signal exceeds
the threshold setting. Set the threshold high enough so that it is not triggered by background noise, but
low enough that you capture all of the signal. (0–127)
```
#### 14.1.4 SRC

```
Source selects between different incoming audio sources to sample from.
```
- IN L sets the input source to INPUT L.
- IN R sets the input source to INPUT R.
- IN L+R sets the input source to INPUT L+R. The audio is summed together to mono.
- MAIN L sets the input source to the Digitakt internal main audio left channel.
- MAIN R sets the input source to the Digitakt internal main audio right channel.
- MAIN L+R sets the input source to the Digitakt internal main audio L+R channels. The audio is
summed together to mono.
- USB L sets the input source to USB (left channel) and lets you sample audio using Overbridge or
from a connected class compliant audio host.
- USB R sets the input source to USB (right channel) and lets you sample audio using Overbridge or
from a connected class compliant audio host.
- USB L+R sets the input source to USB (left+right channel) and lets you sample audio using Over-
bridge or from a connected class compliant audio host. The audio is summed together to mono.
- TRK1–8 sets the input source to one of the Digitakt internal tracks 1–8.


##### 14. SAMPLING

#### 14.1.5 MON

```
Selects the option to monitor the incoming audio through the Digitakt or not. The MON parameter is only
available if SRC is set to one of the IN settings. (NO, YES)
```
- Setting the MON parameter to YES disables the External In mixer functionality. For more
    information, please see “13.6 EXTERNAL MIXER (MASTER PAGE 3)” on page 58.
- The incoming audio is summed together to mono and without effects when MON is set
    to YES.

### 14.2 SAMPLING AUDIO

1. If you use an external audio source, connect it to the Digitakt.
2. Press [SAMPLING] to access the SAMPLING menu and then use DATA ENTRY knob G to set
    SOURCE to your preferred audio input source.
3. Keep an eye on the audio input meter and play the audio source and make sure that the volume of the
    audio source is as strong as possible, but without clipping or distorting. Set MON to YES to monitor
    the incoming audio through the Digitakt.
4. Again, with an eye on the audio input meter, use DATA ENTRY knob F to set THR just above the indi-
    cated background noise of the audio source (when it is not playing).
5. Use RLEN to set the length of the sampling.
6. Press [YES] to arm the sampler and then play the sound source. When the incoming audio signal
    exceeds the set threshold level, sampling will start.
7. Press [YES] when you want to stop sampling, or with an RLEN setting of 1–128, the sampling stops
    automatically. The sampling also stops if it reaches the max sampling time (33 seconds). The Digitakt
    then automatically normalizes the sample.
8. Use the DATA ENTRY knobs A and C to set the parameters TRIM START and TRIM END to trim the
    sample to the desired length. You can use the DATA ENTRY knobs B and D to zoom in and out to
    make it easier to see where to trim the sample. Press [FUNC] + [YES] to preview the sample. (The
    preview is played back by the voice of the active track. Make sure to select an audio track as the active
    track). LOOP makes the previewed sample loop (when enabled). Press [LEFT] to toggle LOOP on/off.
    Press [YES] to trim the sample. After you have trimmed the sample, you can press [NO] to untrim the
    sample if you are not happy with the result.
9. Press [YES] to save the sample.
10. Name the sample and press [YES] again to confirm the save.
11. Press [TRACK 1–8] if you want to select a track to where you want to assign the sample. Press [NO] if
    you don’t want to assign the sample to a track.

### 14.3 DIRECT SAMPLING

```
You can also perform sampling without using the SAMPLING menu. This is achieved by a set of key press
combinations. The sampler will use the SRC and THR settings that were last used.
```
1. Press [SAMPLING] + [YES] to arm the sampler. The [SAMPLING] key turns yellow.
    You can also start direct sampling without arming the sampler first. Press [FUNC] + [SAMPLING] to
    manually start sampling.
2. When the incoming audio signal exceeds the set threshold level (or you manually start direct sam-
    pling), the sampling starts, and the [SAMPLING] key turns red.
3. Press [FUNC] + [SAMPLING] again to stop sampling. The [SAMPLING] key first turns dark red while
    normalizing the sample, then green when it is done.
Press [SAMPLING] + [NO] to cancel at any stage of the Direct Sampling process.


##### 14. SAMPLING

### 14.4 ASSIGNING A SAMPLE TO A TRACK FROM THE +DRIVE

You can also assign samples from the +Drive storage in the Digitakt to the tracks.

1. Press [SETTINGS] to access the SETTINGS menu, and then select SAMPLES and press [YES].
2. Use the [ARROW] keys to navigate to the sample you want to assign, and then press [YES] to select
    the sample.
3. Press [RIGHT], and then select LOAD TO PROJ and press [YES] to copy and load the sample to
    the project.
4. Press [YES] to confirm.
5. Press [SETTINGS] to exit SETTINGS menu.

For more information, please see “15.2 SAMPLES” on page 63.

### 14.5 SAMPLE PLAYBACK

Once the sample is assigned to a track, it can be triggered either by the sequencer or manually by pressing
a [TRIG] key. You also have the ability to set the samples play mode and edit what portion of the sample is
played.

1. Press [SRC] to access the SOURCE page.
2. Use DATA ENTRY knob B to set the PLAY MODE behavior of the sample.
    - REVERSE The sample will be played back in reverse once every time it is trigged.
    - REVERSE LOOP The sample will loop continuously in reverse between Loop Position and Length.
    How long it will loop for is set with the LEN parameter on the TRIG page. The loop time is also con-
    strained by the AMP page envelope parameter settings HLD and DEC.
    - FORWARD LOOP The sample will loop continuously between Loop Position and Length. How long it
    will loop for is set with the LEN parameter on the TRIG page. The loop time is also constrained by the
    AMP page envelope parameters HLD and DEC.
    - FORWARD The sample will be played back once every time it is trigged.
3. Use DATA ENTRY knobs E, F, and G to set the STRT, LEN, and LOOP parameters which define what
    portion of the sample is played. Press [SRC] twice to access SRC page 2, in order to more easily see
    these settings using the sample waveform. For more information, please see “11.3 SRC PAGE” on page
    44.
4. • STRT Start sets the start position for the playback of the sample.
    - LEN Length sets the length of the playback of the sample. Start + Length effectively defines the end
    point of the portion of the sample that is played.
    - LOOP Loop Position sets the position in the sample to where playback will return after reaching the
    Length Position (defined by STRT + LEN) if PLAY MODE is set to FORWARD LOOP or REVERSE
    LOOP. The sample then loops between the end of LEN, and LOOP.

For more information, please see “11.3 SRC PAGE” on page 44.

## APPENDIX A: MACHINES

## APPENDIX A: MACHINES

```
There are different machines available in the Digitakt. A machine is a sound engine that uses a particu-
lar subset of the functionality of the sample playback engine. You can assign any machine to any audio
track. Every machine has a specific set of parameters tailored to give you the most relevant and useful
sound-shaping possibilities for that particular machine. For more information, please see “5.3.1 AUDIO
TRACKS AND MACHINES” on page 17.
```
### A.1 ASSIGNING A MACHINE TO THE ACTIVE TRACK

1. Press [FUNC] + [SRC] to open the MACHINE menu.
2. Use the [UP]/[DOWN] keys to select machine, and then press [YES] to assign the selected machine
    to the track.

```
The rest of this appendix lists the machine-specific parameters on the SRC pages. The selected machine
determines the parameters available. SRC page 2 contains the same parameters as on page 1 but with
a graphical representation of the parameters and a view of the sample waveform. For more information,
please see “11.3 SRC PAGE” on page 44.
```
### A.2 ONESHOT

```
The Oneshot machine is the default machine and plays the sample linearly (forward, reversed, or looped).
Press [SRC] to access this parameter page and to toggle between page 1 and page 2.
```
##### A.2.1 TUNE

```
Tune sets the pitch of the sample. The knob works in a bipolar fashion, and a value of 0 leaves the pitch
unchanged. Press and hold [FUNC], and then turn the DATA ENTRY knob to snap parameter values
to full octaves. Press and turn the DATA ENTRY knob to snap parameter values to semitones (-60.00–
+24.00)
```
```
A.2.2 PLAY
Play Mode sets the play mode of the sample. It controls how the sample will be played back when it is
trigged.
The different modes are:
```
- REVERSE The sample will be played back in reverse once every time it is trigged.
- REVERSE LOOP The sample will loop continuously in reverse between Loop Position and Length.
How long it will loop for is set with the LEN parameter on the TRIG page. This time is also constrained
by the AMP page envelope parameters HLD and DEC.
- FORWARD LOOP The sample starts at the STRT position and will loop continuously between Loop
Position and Length. How long it will loop for is set with the LEN parameter on the TRIG page. This
time is also constrained by the AMP page envelope parameters HLD and DEC.
- FORWARD The sample will be played back once every time it is triggered.


##### APPENDIX A: MACHINES

##### A.2.3 BR

```
Bit Reduction. Increasing the value of this parameter decreases the resolution of the sample, making it
more lo-fi. (0–127)
```
```
A.2.4 SAMP
Sample Select. Here you can browse the list of up to 127 samples loaded to the project, and assign them
to the audio tracks. The first position, OFF, plays no sample. You must load a sample from the +Drive to
the project before assigning it to a track. For more information, please see “14.4 ASSIGNING A SAMPLE
TO A TRACK FROM THE +DRIVE” on page 61. You can apply parameter locks to the SAMP parame-
ter and change the sample on any step of the sequencer, so called Sample locks. For more information,
please see “10.9.1 PARAMETER LOCKS” on page 37. (OFF, 1–127)
```
```
A.2.5 STRT
Start sets the start position for playback of the sample. (0.00–120.00)
```
```
A.2.6 LEN
Length sets the length of the playback of the sample. Start + Length effectively defines the end point of
the portion of the sample that is played. (0.00–120.00)
```
```
A.2.7 LOOP
Loop Pos sets the position in the sample to where playback will return to after reaching the Length
Position (defined by STRT + LEN) of the sample if PLAY MODE is set to FORWARD LOOP or REVERSE
LOOP. The sample is then looped between the end of LEN and LOOP. (0.00–120.00)
```
```
A.2.8 LEV
Sample Level sets the level of the sample. (0.00–127.00)
```

```
A.3.3 BR
Bit Reduction. Increasing the value of this parameter decreases the resolution of the sample, making it
more lo-fi. (0–127)
```
```
A.3.4 SAMP
Sample Select. Here you can browse the list of up to 127 samples loaded to the project, and assign them
to the audio tracks. The first position, OFF, plays no sample. You must load a sample from the +Drive to
the project before assigning it to a track. For more information, please see “14.4 ASSIGNING A SAMPLE

```
```
A.3.5 SEG
Segment Size determines the size of the segments, effectively setting the number of segments the sam-
ple is cut into. The higher the value, the larger/fewer segments. The cuts between the segments is made
at the nearest zero amplitude crossing. (1/32, 1/16, 1/8)
```
```
A.3.6 MODE
Segment Mode lets you select how each individual segment will be played back.
The different modes are:
```
- REVERSE Each segment will be played in reverse once.
- REVERSE LOOP Each segment will loop continuously in reverse until the next segment starts to play.
- FORWARD LOOP Each segment will loop continuously forward until the next segment starts to play.
- FORWARD Each segment will be played in forward mode once every time it is triggered.

```
A.3.7 BARS
Bars sets the total duration of the sample measured in bars and is relative to the set BPM. (1, 2, 4, 8)
```

##### APPENDIX A: MACHINES

##### A.3.8 LEV

```
Sample Level sets the level of the sample. (0.00–127.00)
```
### A.4 REPITCH

The Repitch machine allows samples and loops to be automatically stretched to the tempo of your pattern.
It achieves this by automatically applying repitching of the sample to match the target tempo. Press [SRC]
to access this parameter page and to toggle between page 1 and page 2.

##### A.4.1 PLAY

```
Play Mode sets the play mode of the sample. It controls how the sample will be played back when it is
trigged.
The different modes are:
```
- REVERSE The sample will be played back in reverse once every time it is trigged.
- REVERSE LOOP The sample will loop continuously in reverse between Loop Position and Length.
How long it will loop for is set with the LEN parameter on the TRIG page. This time is also constrained
by the AMP page envelope parameters HLD and DEC.
- FORWARD LOOP The sample starts at the STRT position and will loop continuously between Loop
Position and Length. How long it will loop for is set with the LEN parameter on the TRIG page. This
time is also constrained by the AMP page envelope parameters HLD and DEC.
- FORWARD The sample will be played back once every time it is triggered.

```
A.4.2 BR

```
```
A.4.4 STRT
Start sets the start position for playback of the sample. (0.00–120.00)
```
```
A.4.5 LEN
Length sets the length of the playback of the sample. Start + Length effectively defines the end point of
the portion of the sample that is played. (0.00–120.00)
```
```
A.4.6 BARS
Bars sets the total duration of the sample measured in bars and is relative to the set BPM. (1, 2, 4, 8)
```
```
A.4.7 LEV
Sample Level sets the level of the sample. (0.00–127.00)
```

##### APPENDIX A: MACHINES

### A.5 SLICE

```
The Slice machine allows samples to be automatically sliced into similarly-sized segments (slices) and trig-
gered individually. Press [SRC] to access this parameter page and to toggle between page 1 and page 2.
```
##### A.5.1 TUNE

```
Tune sets the pitch of the sample. It controls the pitch of the played back segments, allowing you to
control the overall pitch without affecting the timing of the loop or sample. The knob works in a bipolar
fashion, and a value of 0 leaves the pitch unchanged. Press and hold [FUNC], and then turn the DATA
ENTRY knob to snap parameter values to full octaves. Press and turn the DATA ENTRY knob to snap
parameter values to semitones. (-60.00–+24.00)
```
```
A.5.2 PLAY
Play Mode sets the play mode of the sample. It controls how the sample will be played back when it is
trigged.
The different modes are:
```
- REVERSE The sample will be played back in reverse once every time it is trigged.
- REVERSE LOOP The sample will loop continuously in reverse between Loop Position and Length.
How long it will loop for is set with the LEN parameter on the TRIG page. This time is also constrained
by the AMP page envelope parameters HLD and DEC.
- FORWARD LOOP The sample starts at the STRT position and will loop continuously between Loop
Position and Length. How long it will loop for is set with the LEN parameter on the TRIG page. This
time is also constrained by the AMP page envelope parameters HLD and DEC.
- FORWARD The sample will be played back once every time it is trigged.

```
A.5.3 BR
Bit Reduction. Increasing the value of this parameter decreases the resolution of the sample, making it
more lo-fi. (0–127)
```
```
A.5.4 SAMP
Sample Select. Here you can browse the list of up to 127 samples loaded to the project, and assign them
to the audio tracks. The first position, OFF, plays no sample. You must load a sample from the +Drive to
the project before assigning it to a track. For more information, please see “14.4 ASSIGNING A SAMPLE
TO A TRACK FROM THE +DRIVE” on page 61. You can apply parameter locks to the SAMP parame-
ter and change the sample on any step of the sequencer, so called Sample locks. For more information,
please see “10.9.1 PARAMETER LOCKS” on page 37. (OFF, 1–127)
```
```
A.5.5 SLICE
Slice Select lets you set which slice to play. If set to NOTE you can use the TRIG keys in CHROMATIC
mode or incoming MIDI note data to determine which slice to play. (NOTE, 1–64)
```
```
All the settings in the KEYBOARD SETUP menu are ignored for a track that uses the
Slice machine and when SLICE is set to NOTE. Instead slices plays from C1 and upwards,
wrapping around after the last slice. The first slice is highlighted with a blue [TRIG] key in
KEYBOARD mode.
```
```
A.5.6 LEN
Slice Length sets how many slices that will play consecutively. (1–64)
```

##### APPENDIX A: MACHINES

##### A.5.7 GRID

Slice Grid sets the number of slices the sample is cut in. The slices are evenly spread out over the whole
length of the sample. The cuts between the slices are done at the nearest zero amplitude crossing. (4, 8,
16, 32, 64)

A.5.8 LEV

Sample Level sets the level of the sample. (0.00–127.00)

```
By using parameter locks of the SLICE parameter, you can set which slice the sequencer
will play on a trig. But you can also automatically allocate slices to already placed trigs.
There are two different choices for how they can be allocated.
LINEAR LOCKS The slices are allocated linearly to the trigs, starting with the first slice on
the first placed trig.
RANDOM LOCKS The slices are allocated randomly to the trigs.
```
1. Select the Slice machine for the active track.
2. Place trigs on the sequencer.
3. Press [YES] to open the ALLOCATE SLICE menu
4. Use [UP] / [DOWN] to select CREATE LINEAR LOCKS or CREATE RANDOM LOCKS
5. Press [YES] to create locks to allocate slices. With CREATE RANDOM LOCKS se-
    lected, the slice allocation will randomize every time you press [YES].
6. Press [NO] to exit the menu.
