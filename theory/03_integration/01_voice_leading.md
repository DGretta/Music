# Voice Leading

**Smooth transitions between chords and independent melodic lines**

---

## The Core Concept

**Voice leading** is the art of moving individual notes (voices) smoothly from one chord to the next. While progressions tell you **which chords** to use, voice leading tells you **how to connect them**.

**Why voice leading matters:**
- Creates smooth, musical transitions between chords
- Avoids awkward jumps and jarring movement
- Enables multiple independent melodic lines (polyphony)
- Makes chord progressions sound professional vs amateurish
- Essential for arrangement, counterpoint, and sophisticated harmony

**The practical reality:** When you program chord changes and some transitions sound rough while others sound smooth, that's voice leading at work. Understanding voice leading means understanding **how to make harmony flow** rather than lurch.

## The Three Principles of Good Voice Leading

### 1. Minimal Movement (Efficient Motion)

**Move each voice by the smallest possible distance.**

**Poor voice leading (large jumps):**
```
C major → F major (root position both)

Voice 1: G → C  (+5 semitones, awkward jump)
Voice 2: E → A  (+5 semitones, awkward jump)
Voice 3: C → F  (+5 semitones, awkward jump)

All voices jump - sounds disconnected
```

**Good voice leading (minimal movement):**
```
C major → F major (using inversion)

Voice 1: G → A  (+2 semitones, smooth)
Voice 2: E → F  (+1 semitone, smooth)
Voice 3: C → C  (0 semitones, common tone)

Voices move minimally - sounds connected
```

**Why this works:**
- Small movements sound natural and smooth
- Maintains continuity between chords
- Easier to sing/play/follow
- Creates coherent harmonic flow

---

### 2. Common Tones (Held Notes)

**Keep notes that exist in both chords.**

**Example: C major → A minor**
```
C major: C-E-G
A minor: A-C-E

Common tones: C and E (exist in both chords)
```

**Good voice leading using common tones:**
```
Voice 1: G → A  (moves by step, +2 semitones)
Voice 2: E → E  (stays, common tone)
Voice 3: C → C  (stays, common tone)

Two voices hold, one moves - very smooth
```

**Why this works:**
- Holding common tones creates stability through the change
- Minimizes total movement
- Creates strong connection between chords
- Natural and easy to execute

---

### 3. Contrary Motion (Opposite Directions)

**When one voice goes up, another goes down.**

**Parallel motion (avoid):**
```
C major → F major

Voice 1: G → C  (up +5)
Voice 2: E → A  (up +5)
Voice 3: C → F  (up +5)

All voices move in same direction - sounds like block chords
```

**Contrary motion (better):**
```
C major → F major

Voice 1: G → A  (up +2)
Voice 2: E → F  (up +1)
Voice 3: C → C  (stays) or C → F (up +5, bass voice exception)

Upper voices move up, bass can move differently
Creates independence and interest
```

**Why this works:**
- Creates sense of multiple independent lines
- Prevents "parallel" sound (block chord movement)
- More sophisticated and interesting
- Fundamental to counterpoint

---

## Chord Inversions and Voice Leading

### Root Position vs Inversions

**Root position (root in bass):**
```
C major root position: C-E-G
Bass note: C
```

**First inversion (third in bass):**
```
C major first inversion: E-G-C
Bass note: E
```

**Second inversion (fifth in bass):**
```
C major second inversion: G-C-E
Bass note: G
```

**Why inversions matter for voice leading:**
Inversions allow you to keep upper voices smooth while bass moves.

---

### Voice Leading I-IV-V-I with Inversions

**All root position (poor voice leading):**
```
I (C):     G    IV (F):    C    V (G):     D    I (C):     G
           E              A              B              E
           C              F              G              C

Large jumps: E→A (+5), G→C (+5), A→B (+2), C→D (+2), B→E (+5)
Sounds blocky, disconnected
```

**Using inversions (good voice leading):**
```
I (C):     G    IV (F):    A    V (G):     G    I (C):     G
           E              F              D              E
           C              C              B              C

Smooth movement:
- Voice 1: G→A (+2), A→G (-2), G→G (0)
- Voice 2: E→F (+1), F→D (-3), D→E (+2)
- Voice 3: C→C (0), C→B (-1), B→C (+1)

Mostly steps, common tones, smooth flow
```

**The difference:**
- Root position progression: Jumpy, blocky
- Inversion-based progression: Smooth, connected, professional

## Voice Leading Specific Progressions

### I-vi-IV-V (Smooth Voice Leading)

**Using inversions and common tones:**
```
I (C maj):      G    vi (A min):    A    IV (F maj):   A    V (G maj):    G
                E                   E                  F                  D
                C                   C                  C                  B

Voice 1: G → A (+2) → A (0) → G (-2)
Voice 2: E → E (0) → F (+1) → D (-3)
Voice 3: C → C (0) → C (0) → B (-1)

All movements small, multiple common tones
```

**Why this progression is so popular:**
Naturally smooth voice leading - minimal effort for maximum smoothness.

### ii-V-I (Jazz Progression Voice Leading)

**With seventh chords:**
```
ii (Dm7):       C    V (G7):        B    I (Cmaj7):     B
                A                   F                   G
                F                   D                   E
                D                   G                   C

Voice 1: C → B (-1) → B (0)
Voice 2: A → F (-4) → G (+2)
Voice 3: F → D (-3) → E (+2)
Voice 4: D → G (+5) → C (+5, bass movement)

Upper voices mostly stepwise
Bass makes larger movement (functional bass line)
Tritone in G7 (B-F) resolves inward: B→C, F→E
```

**The G7 tritone resolution:**
- B (leading tone) wants to resolve up to C
- F (flat seventh) wants to resolve down to E
- This pull creates the strong V-I resolution
- Classic dominant-to-tonic voice leading

---

## Multiple Independent Voices

### Two-Voice Counterpoint

**Two melodic lines moving independently but harmonically:**

**Example:**
```
Bar 1:
Upper:  C    D    E    F    E    D    C    (mostly stepwise)
Lower:  C    B    A    G    A    B    C    (contrary motion)
        Both create melody, both follow harmony
```

**Principles:**
- Each voice should be melodic on its own
- Voices should move primarily in contrary or oblique motion
- Avoid parallel fifths and octaves (sounds hollow)
- Create independence while maintaining harmony

---

### Three-Voice Harmony

**Classic SATB-style (Soprano-Alto-Tenor-Bass equivalent):**

```
Progression: C major → G major → A minor → F major

Voice 1 (top):    G    →    G    →    A    →    A
Voice 2 (mid):    E    →    D    →    E    →    F
Voice 3 (low):    C    →    B    →    C    →    C

Analysis:
C→G: Voice 1 stays (G common tone), Voice 2 steps down (E→D), Voice 3 steps down (C→B)
G→Am: Voice 1 steps up (G→A), Voice 2 steps up (D→E), Voice 3 steps up (B→C)
Am→F: Voice 1 stays (A common tone), Voice 2 steps up (E→F), Voice 3 stays (C common tone)

Smooth, independent, each voice makes musical sense alone
```

---

## Voice Leading Rules and Guidelines

### Rules (Classical, Can Be Broken Carefully)

**1. Avoid parallel fifths:**
```
Bad:
Voice 1: C → G  (perfect fifth interval)
Voice 2: F → C  (both move maintaining perfect fifth)

Why: Sounds hollow, medieval, reduces independence
```

**2. Avoid parallel octaves:**
```
Bad:
Voice 1: C → F  (octave apart)
Voice 2: C → F  (both move maintaining octave)

Why: Voices blend completely, lose independence
```

**3. Avoid hidden/direct fifths and octaves:**
```
Bad:
Voice 1: C → G  (leap)
Voice 2: E → G  (both arrive at G)

Why: Similar motion to same note weakens independence
```

**Modern context:**
These rules come from Renaissance/Baroque counterpoint. In modern music (especially electronic), parallel fifths can be intentional (power chord movement, parallel harmony). **Know the rule to break it intentionally.**

---

### Guidelines (Flexible)

**1. Resolve leading tones upward:**
```
In G major (V) → C major (I):
B (leading tone) → C (tonic)
Natural tendency, strong pull
```

**2. Resolve seventh of dominant chord downward:**
```
In G7 (V7) → C major (I):
F (seventh) → E (third of tonic)
Completes the resolution
```

**3. Double the root, not the third:**
```
C major with four voices:
✓ C-E-G-C (double root)
✗ C-E-E-G (double third, sounds wrong)
```

**4. Keep voices in reasonable range:**
```
Avoid huge gaps between adjacent voices
Avoid voices crossing (soprano below alto, etc.)
```

---

## Voice Leading in Practice

### Programming Multi-Voice Sequences

**Sequencer approach for smooth progressions:**

**Step 1: Program chord progression (harmony)**
```
Bar 1: C major
Bar 2: F major
Bar 3: G major
Bar 4: C major
```

**Step 2: Assign each voice to a track/oscillator**
```
Track 1 (Voice 1, highest): 
Track 2 (Voice 2, middle):
Track 3 (Voice 3, lowest):
```

**Step 3: Program each voice with smooth movement**
```
Track 1: G → A → G → G  (mostly stays high, minimal movement)
Track 2: E → F → D → E  (stepwise movement)
Track 3: C → C → B → C  (mostly steps, some common tones)
```

**Result:** Three voices creating full harmony with smooth transitions.

---

### Bass Line and Upper Voices

**Bass voice gets different treatment:**

**Bass can make larger leaps** (roots of chords, functional movement)
```
Bass: C → F → G → C  (+5, +2, +5 - larger movements okay)
```

**Upper voices stay smooth** (voice leading principles apply)
```
Voice 1: G → A → G → G  (mostly stepwise)
Voice 2: E → F → D → E  (all stepwise)
```

**Why:** Bass provides harmonic foundation (can emphasize roots), upper voices create melodic smoothness.

---

### Modular Synthesis Application

**Three oscillators creating voiced progression:**

**Bar 1: C major**
```
OSC 1: +0.583V  (G, fifth)
OSC 2: +0.333V  (E, major third)
OSC 3: 0V       (C, root)
```

**Bar 2: F major (smooth voice leading)**
```
OSC 1: +0.75V   (A, up +2 semitones from G)
OSC 2: +0.417V  (F, up +1 semitone from E)
OSC 3: 0V       (C, stays - common tone!)
```

**Bar 3: G major**
```
OSC 1: +0.583V  (G, down -2 semitones from A)
OSC 2: +0.167V  (D, down -3 semitones from F)
OSC 3: -0.083V  (B, down -1 semitone from C)
```

**Bar 4: C major (return)**
```
OSC 1: +0.583V  (G, stays)
OSC 2: +0.333V  (E, up +2 semitones from D)
OSC 3: 0V       (C, up +1 semitone from B)
```

**Note voltage changes:**
- Small voltage adjustments between chords
- Common tones maintained when possible
- Smooth voice leading through careful voltage programming

## Advanced Voice Leading Techniques

### Voice Exchange

**Two voices swap positions:**

```
Bar 1: C major       Bar 2: F major
Voice 1: G           Voice 1: C  (was Voice 3's note)
Voice 2: E           Voice 2: A
Voice 3: C           Voice 3: F  (was Voice 1's note)

Voices 1 and 3 exchange G ↔ C
Creates interesting movement while maintaining smoothness
```

---

### Pedal Point (Sustained Bass)

**One voice (usually bass) holds while others move:**

```
Voice 1: G    A    B    C    (ascending line)
Voice 2: E    F    G    E    (moving)
Voice 3: C    C    C    C    (sustained pedal point)

Harmony changes above sustained C
Creates tension and resolution
Common in classical and electronic music
```

---

### Chromatic Voice Leading

**Using chromatic (half-step) movement between chords:**

```
C major → C minor
Voice 1: G → G  (stays)
Voice 2: E → Eb (down 1 semitone, chromatic)
Voice 3: C → C  (stays)

Smooth chromatic change: major → minor
```

---

## Common Confusions Addressed

### "Do I always have to follow voice leading rules?"

**No - understand them, then break them intentionally.**

**Classical music:** Strict voice leading rules (avoid parallels, etc.)
**Jazz:** More flexible, chromatic voice leading
**Rock/Pop:** Often parallel movement (intentional for sound)
**Electronic:** Very flexible, can use parallel fifths for power

**Key:** Know the principles, use them when smoothness matters, break them when you want different effects.

---

### "What about block chords? Are those always wrong?"

**No - block chords (parallel movement) have their place:**

**When to use block chords:**
- Power chords moving in parallel (rock/metal)
- Pad chords (thick, sustained)
- Emphasis moments (climax, resolution)
- Intentional "blocky" sound (electronic music aesthetic)

**When voice leading matters more:**
- Multiple melodic lines (counterpoint)
- Smooth harmonic transitions (ballads, jazz)
- Classical/traditional harmony
- When you want sophistication and flow

---

### "How do I voice lead if I'm using arpeggiators?"

**Arpeggios complicate voice leading:**

**Challenge:**
```
Arpeggio plays all chord notes sequentially
Can't maintain common tones
Can't control individual voice movement
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Program chord inversions** that would voice lead smoothly if played together
2. **Use multiple arpeggiators** with different patterns per voice
3. **Accept that arpeggios prioritize pattern over voice leading**
4. **Use voice leading for pad chords**, arpeggios for rhythmic interest

**Reality:** Arpeggios and strict voice leading don't always coexist. Choose what serves the music.

---

### "Does voice leading apply to bass lines?"

**Yes and no:**

**Bass voice gets more freedom:**
- Can make larger leaps (emphasizing chord roots)
- Often moves by fourths/fifths (functional movement)
- Provides harmonic foundation (different job than upper voices)

**But:**
- Stepwise bass lines sound smooth (walking bass)
- Excessive leaping sounds disconnected
- Some voice leading principles still apply (approach tones, direction)

**Balance:** Bass emphasizes harmony (can leap), upper voices emphasize melody (stay smooth).

---

## Try This (If You Want)

### Exercise 1: Voice Leading Analysis

**Goal:** Understand smooth vs rough voice leading (requires chord-capable instrument).

**How:**
1. Play I-IV-V-I progression in root position (all root notes in bass)
2. Notice the jumps - sounds blocky
3. Play same progression using inversions for smooth voice leading
4. Notice the difference - sounds connected, professional
5. Try other progressions, find smoothest voice leading

**What you'll discover:**
- Small movements sound better than large jumps
- Common tones create stability
- Inversions enable smooth voice leading
- Professional vs amateur often comes down to voice leading

---

### Exercise 2: Program Smooth Progression

**Goal:** Create smooth multi-voice sequence (requires multi-track sequencer or multiple oscillators).

**How:**
1. Choose simple progression: I-vi-IV-V (C-Am-F-G)
2. Program three voices/tracks with smooth movement:
   - Voice 1: G-A-A-G (mostly stays high)
   - Voice 2: E-E-F-D (common tones, steps)
   - Voice 3: C-C-C-B (mostly holds, one step)
3. Listen to each voice independently (should be melodic)
4. Listen to all together (should be harmonically smooth)

**What you'll discover:**
- Good voice leading creates both harmonic and melodic satisfaction
- Each voice should make sense alone
- Small adjustments = big difference in smoothness

---

### Exercise 3: Contrary Motion Practice

**Goal:** Experience contrary motion between voices (requires two-voice capability).

**How:**
1. Program Voice 1: C-D-E-F-G (ascending)
2. Program Voice 2: C-B-A-G-F (descending, contrary motion)
3. Listen - sounds independent and interesting
4. Try parallel motion (both ascending) - sounds bland
5. Try oblique motion (one moves, one stays) - sounds smooth

**What you'll discover:**
- Contrary motion creates independence
- Parallel motion sounds like one voice
- Mix of motion types creates interest

**Not feeling it?** Just notice when chord changes sound smooth vs rough - that's voice leading quality.

## What You Should Remember

**Core understanding:**
- Voice leading is the art of smooth movement between chords
- Three principles: minimal movement, common tones, contrary motion
- Inversions enable smooth voice leading
- Each voice should be melodic on its own
- Classical rules (avoid parallels) can be broken intentionally in modern music

**Essential techniques:**
- **Minimal movement:** Move voices by smallest distance possible
- **Common tones:** Hold notes that exist in both chords
- **Contrary motion:** When one voice goes up, another goes down
- **Chord inversions:** Rearrange notes for smoother movement
- **Independent voices:** Each voice should make melodic sense alone

**Practical application:**
- Programming smooth chord progressions
- Multi-track sequences with independent melodic lines
- Using inversions to minimize voice movement
- Creating professional-sounding harmonic transitions
- Bass voice gets more freedom, upper voices stay smooth

**What you don't need to memorize:**
- Every voice leading rule from classical counterpoint
- All parallel motion prohibitions (modern music is flexible)
- Complex chromatic voice leading patterns (advanced)
- SATB voice range rules (synthesis transcends vocal ranges)

**What matters:**
Understanding that smooth progressions come from careful attention to how individual notes move between chords. Good voice leading creates both harmonic satisfaction and melodic interest. This is what separates professional-sounding progressions from blocky, amateur chord changes.
