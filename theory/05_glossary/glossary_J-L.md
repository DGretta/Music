## J

### Just Intonation
**Music Theory/Physics:** A tuning system based on pure frequency ratios (3:2, 5:4, etc.). Produces perfectly consonant intervals but makes modulation between keys difficult.

**Synthesis:** Some modules offer just intonation tuning. Creates pure harmonies but limits flexibility compared to equal temperament.

**Frequency:** Perfect fifth = exactly 3:2 (1.5000), not 2^(7/12) ≈ 1.498 as in equal temperament.

**See also:** Equal Temperament, Tuning, Consonance

## K

### Key
**Music Theory:** The tonal center of a piece, defined by a tonic note and scale (major or minor). Example: "Key of C major" means C is tonic and uses C major scale notes.

**Synthesis:** Determines quantizer scale programming. Changing key = reprogramming quantizer or transposing sequences.

**See also:** Tonic, Scale, Modulation, Quantizer

### Key Signature
**Music Theory:** The collection of sharps or flats at the beginning of a staff indicating which notes are altered throughout the piece. Establishes the key.

**Synthesis:** Conceptual tool for understanding which notes are "in" the key. Quantizers effectively enforce key signature by only allowing certain pitches.

**See also:** Key, Scale, Accidental

## L

### Leading Tone
**Music Theory:** The seventh scale degree, one semitone below the tonic. Creates strong pull toward resolution to tonic. In C major, B is the leading tone.

**Synthesis:** Voltage: +0.917V (11 semitones from root). Use in melodies to create tension before resolving to tonic.

**See also:** Scale Degree, Tonic, Resolution

### Legato
**Music Theory:** Smooth, connected playing with no silence between notes. Opposite of staccato.

**Synthesis:** Achieved with overlapping gates and/or portamento. Many synthesizers have legato mode that only retriggers envelopes when gates don't overlap.

**See also:** Staccato, Portamento, Gate

### LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator)
**Synthesis:** An oscillator running below audio range (typically 0.1-20 Hz) used for modulation. Creates vibrato, tremolo, filter sweeps, and rhythmic effects.

**See also:** Modulation, Vibrato, Tremolo

### Loop
**Synthesis/Composition:** A repeating musical pattern or section. Foundation of electronic music, hip-hop, and much modern production.

**See also:** Ostinato, Pattern, Sequence
