## V

### VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifier)
**Synthesis:** A module that controls amplitude (volume) using CV. Essential for shaping dynamics and creating envelopes. The final stage in most synthesis signal paths.

**See also:** Envelope, Dynamics, CV

### VCF (Voltage Controlled Filter)
**Synthesis:** A filter whose cutoff frequency is controlled by CV. Core tone-shaping tool in subtractive synthesis. Envelope modulation of VCF creates signature synth sounds.

**See also:** Filter, Cutoff, Envelope, Subtractive Synthesis

### VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator)
**Synthesis:** An oscillator whose frequency is controlled by CV. The primary sound source in most synthesis. Typically follows 1V/octave standard for pitch control.

**See also:** Oscillator, CV, 1V/Octave, Pitch

### Velocity
**Music Theory/Synthesis:** The speed or force with which a key is pressed, determining note volume and sometimes timbre. MIDI velocity values: 0-127.

**Synthesis:** Used to control dynamics, filter cutoff, or other parameters for expression. Many modular systems don't natively support velocity without MIDI-to-CV conversion.

**See also:** Dynamics, MIDI, Expression

### Verse
**Music Theory:** A repeated section of a song with the same melody but typically different lyrics each time. Usually lower energy than the chorus.

**Synthesis:** Often features sparser arrangement than chorus - fewer layers, more closed filter, or simpler patterns.

**See also:** Form, Chorus, Section, Arrangement

### Vibrato
**Music Theory/Synthesis:** Periodic variation in pitch, creating a wavering effect. Adds expressiveness and warmth to sustained notes.

**Synthesis:** LFO modulating oscillator pitch (typically 4-8 Hz rate, subtle depth). Natural vibrato is around 5-6 Hz.

**See also:** Tremolo, LFO, Modulation, Pitch

### Voice
**Synthesis:** A complete signal path from oscillator through filters and amplifier. The number of voices = polyphony (number of simultaneous notes). Monophonic synths have one voice.

**See also:** Polyphonic, Monophonic, Oscillator

### Voice Leading
**Music Theory:** The practice of moving smoothly from one chord to another, with each voice (part) moving by the smallest possible intervals. Prioritizes stepwise motion and common tones.

**Synthesis:** In multi-oscillator setups, program CV sequences that move minimally between chord changes. Essential for smooth, professional-sounding progressions.

**See also:** Stepwise Motion, Common Tone, Chord Progression

### Voicing
**Music Theory:** The specific arrangement of notes in a chord, including which notes are doubled, their octave placement, and spacing. Different voicings of the same chord create different colors and textures.

**Synthesis:** Voltage relationships between oscillators. Close voicing = notes within one octave. Open voicing = notes spread across multiple octaves.

**See also:** Chord, Inversion, Spacing

### Voltage
**Synthesis:** Electrical potential difference used as control signal in modular synthesis. Typical ranges: 0-5V or 0-10V for modulation, ±5V for audio, 1V/octave for pitch.

**See also:** CV, 1V/Octave, Gate

## W

### Waveform
**Synthesis:** The shape of an audio signal's oscillation. Basic waveforms: sine (pure tone), triangle (mellow), sawtooth (bright, harmonically rich), square/pulse (hollow, reedy). Determines harmonic content and timbre.

**See also:** Oscillator, Harmonic, Timbre

### Whole Note
**Music Theory:** A note lasting four beats in 4/4 time, or the full duration of a measure. The longest common note value.

**Synthesis:** In 16-step sequencer at 120 BPM with 16th note resolution, whole note = entire 16 steps. Rarely used in electronic music sequencing.

**See also:** Note Value, Half Note, Measure

### Whole Step
**Music Theory:** An interval of two semitones or two half steps. The distance of two piano keys including the one in between.

**Synthesis:** Voltage: 0.167V (2 semitones = 2/12 volt). Building block of major scales and many chord relationships.

**See also:** Semitone, Half Step, Interval
