## M

### Major Chord
**Music Theory:** A triad consisting of a root, major third, and perfect fifth. Formula: 0-4-7 semitones. Sounds bright, stable, and happy.

**Synthesis:** C major = C (0V), E (+0.333V), G (+0.583V). Foundational chord in Western music.

**See also:** Chord, Triad, Minor Chord

### Major Scale
**Music Theory:** A seven-note scale following the pattern: W-W-H-W-W-W-H (whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half). The most common scale in Western music.

**Synthesis:** Voltage pattern in C major: 0V, +0.167V, +0.333V, +0.417V, +0.583V, +0.75V, +0.917V. Foundation for understanding harmony and melody.

**See also:** Scale, Minor Scale, Diatonic

### Major Third
**Music Theory:** An interval spanning three scale degrees or four semitones. A major chord's defining interval.

**Synthesis:** Voltage: +0.333V (4 semitones from root). Creates bright, major tonality.

**Frequency:** 5:4 ratio in just intonation, 2^(4/12) ≈ 1.260 in equal temperament.

**See also:** Interval, Minor Third, Major Chord

### Measure
**Music Theory:** A segment of time defined by the time signature, containing a specific number of beats. Also called a "bar." Divided by bar lines in notation.

**Synthesis:** Sequencer pattern length often corresponds to measures. 16-step sequence in 4/4 = 4 measures if each step = quarter note.

**See also:** Bar, Time Signature, Beat

### Mediant
**Music Theory:** The third scale degree and the chord built on it (iii in major, III in minor). Halfway between tonic and dominant.

**Synthesis:** In C major: E is mediant. Voltage: +0.333V (4 semitones). The iii chord is used for smooth voice leading.

**See also:** Scale Degree, Tonic, Dominant

### Melodic Minor Scale
**Music Theory:** A minor scale with raised sixth and seventh degrees ascending, but natural sixth and seventh descending. Used in jazz and classical music for melodic flexibility.

**Synthesis:** Ascending C melodic minor: 0V, +0.167V, +0.25V, +0.417V, +0.583V, +0.75V, +0.917V. Descending: matches natural minor.

**See also:** Minor Scale, Natural Minor, Harmonic Minor

### Melody
**Music Theory:** A sequence of notes creating a recognizable musical line. The horizontal aspect of music (as opposed to harmony's vertical aspect).

**Synthesis:** Programmed as CV sequences. Effective melodies use stepwise motion, leaps for emphasis, and balance between repetition and variation.

**See also:** Harmony, Sequence, Motif

### Meter
**Music Theory:** The recurring pattern of strong and weak beats, defined by time signature. Common meters: 4/4 (strong-weak-medium-weak), 3/4 (strong-weak-weak), 6/8 (strong-weak-weak-medium-weak-weak).

**Synthesis:** Determines accent patterns in sequences and rhythmic feel. Program accents to match metric structure.

**See also:** Time Signature, Beat, Rhythm

### Middle C
**Music Theory:** The C note near the middle of the piano keyboard. Typically C4 in scientific pitch notation (C3 in some systems). Reference point for pitch.

**Synthesis:** Often used as 0V reference in 1V/octave systems. A4 (440 Hz) = +0.75V from middle C.

**See also:** Pitch, Octave, A440

### Minor Chord
**Music Theory:** A triad consisting of a root, minor third, and perfect fifth. Formula: 0-3-7 semitones. Sounds darker, sadder, or more serious than major.

**Synthesis:** C minor = C (0V), Eb (+0.25V), G (+0.583V). Essential for emotional depth and contrast.

**See also:** Chord, Triad, Major Chord

### Minor Scale
**Music Theory:** A seven-note scale with a flattened third degree compared to major. Three forms: natural, harmonic, and melodic minor.

**Synthesis:** Natural minor voltage pattern in C: 0V, +0.167V, +0.25V, +0.417V, +0.583V, +0.667V, +0.833V.

**See also:** Scale, Major Scale, Natural Minor, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor

### Minor Third
**Music Theory:** An interval spanning three scale degrees or three semitones. A minor chord's defining interval.

**Synthesis:** Voltage: +0.25V (3 semitones from root). Creates dark, minor tonality.

**Frequency:** 6:5 ratio in just intonation, 2^(3/12) ≈ 1.189 in equal temperament.

**See also:** Interval, Major Third, Minor Chord

### Mode
**Music Theory:** A scale type derived from starting on different degrees of the major scale. Seven modes: Ionian (major), Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian (natural minor), Locrian.

**Synthesis:** Quantizer programming for modal scales. Each mode has distinctive character determined by its interval pattern.

**See also:** Scale, Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian

### Modulation
**Music Theory:** Changing from one key to another within a piece. Creates variety, drama, and structural definition.

**Synthesis:** Reprogram quantizer scale or transpose entire sequences. Common techniques: common chord pivot, direct shift, or gradual chromatic movement.

**See also:** Key, Transposition, Pivot Chord

### Monophonic
**Synthesis:** Capable of producing only one note at a time. Most analog synthesizers are monophonic. Opposite of polyphonic.

**See also:** Polyphonic, Voice, Oscillator

### Motif
**Music Theory:** A short, recognizable musical idea that recurs throughout a piece. Building block of larger melodies and themes.

**Synthesis:** Short sequence pattern that's repeated, varied, or developed. Foundation of electronic music composition.

**See also:** Melody, Theme, Sequence

## N

### Natural
**Music Theory:** A symbol (♮) that cancels a sharp or flat, returning the note to its unaltered state. Also refers to notes without accidentals.

**Synthesis:** Returns to base voltage value. B♮ = +0.917V from C (versus Bb = +0.833V or B# = 1V).

**See also:** Accidental, Sharp, Flat

### Natural Minor Scale
**Music Theory:** The basic minor scale, following the pattern: W-H-W-W-H-W-W. Also called Aeolian mode. The relative minor shares the same key signature as its relative major.

**Synthesis:** Voltage pattern in C natural minor: 0V, +0.167V, +0.25V, +0.417V, +0.583V, +0.667V, +0.833V.

**See also:** Minor Scale, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor, Relative Minor

### Neighbor Tone
**Music Theory:** A non-chord tone that moves by step away from and then back to a chord tone. Can be upper or lower neighbor.

**Synthesis:** Brief note deviation in monophonic melody. Creates melodic interest without leaving harmonic context.

**See also:** Non-Chord Tone, Passing Tone, Chord Tone

### Non-Chord Tone
**Music Theory:** A note that doesn't belong to the current chord. Creates tension and melodic interest. Types include passing tones, neighbor tones, suspensions, and appoggiaturas.

**Synthesis:** Use strategically in monophonic melodies for movement and interest while maintaining harmonic clarity through resolution to chord tones.

**See also:** Chord Tone, Passing Tone, Neighbor Tone

### Note
**Music Theory:** A symbol representing a pitch and duration. The basic unit of written music.

**Synthesis:** Represented by CV (pitch) + Gate (timing). Complete note information requires both signals.

**See also:** Pitch, Duration, CV, Gate

### Note Value
**Music Theory:** The duration of a note relative to the beat. Common values: whole (4 beats in 4/4), half (2 beats), quarter (1 beat), eighth (1/2 beat), sixteenth (1/4 beat).

**Synthesis:** Determines gate length in sequencers. Quarter note = 1 step in many 16-step sequences.

**See also:** Duration, Gate, Rhythm

## O

### Oblique Motion
**Music Theory:** Voice leading where one voice sustains a note while another voice moves. Creates smooth connection with minimal movement.

**Synthesis:** Hold CV constant in one sequence/oscillator while another changes. Common in bass + melody patterns.

**See also:** Voice Leading, Parallel Motion, Contrary Motion

### Octave
**Music Theory:** The interval between two pitches where the higher pitch vibrates at exactly twice the frequency of the lower pitch. Spans 12 semitones.

**Synthesis:** Represented as 1V in the 1V/octave standard. Most oscillators track 1V/octave across their CV inputs.

**Frequency:** 2:1 ratio. If A4 = 440 Hz, then A5 = 880 Hz.

**See also:** Interval, Semitone, 1V/Octave Standard

### Ornament
**Music Theory:** Decorative notes that embellish the main melodic line. Includes grace notes, trills, mordents, and turns.

**Synthesis:** Fast sequences, sub-steps, or ratcheting effects. Adds expressiveness to monophonic lines.

**See also:** Grace Note, Trill

### Ostinato
**Music Theory:** A persistently repeated musical phrase or rhythm. Foundation of groove-based music.

**Synthesis:** Repeating sequence pattern. Core technique in electronic music, techno, and minimal music.

**See also:** Form, Section, Arrangement

### Overtone
**Physics/Synthesis:** Frequencies above the fundamental in a harmonic series. Technically, the 2nd overtone = 3rd harmonic (3x fundamental).
