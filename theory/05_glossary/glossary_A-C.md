## A

### Accent
**Music Theory:** Emphasis placed on a particular note or beat, making it stand out from surrounding notes. Created through increased volume, duration, or articulation.

**Synthesis:** Achieved through velocity (if supported), filter emphasis, envelope attack, or layering. In modular systems, can be programmed via sequencer accent tracks or randomized gate voltages.

**See also:** Dynamics, Velocity, Gate

### Arpeggio
**Music Theory:** The notes of a chord played in sequence rather than simultaneously. Can be ascending, descending, or in various patterns.

**Synthesis:** Fundamental technique for monophonic synthesizers to imply harmony. Often programmed as sequences or generated by dedicated arpeggiator modules/circuits.

**See also:** Chord, Monophonic, Sequence

### Augmented Chord
**Music Theory:** A triad consisting of a root, major third, and augmented fifth (raised fifth). Formula: 0-4-8 semitones. Creates tension and instability.

**Synthesis:** C augmented = C (0V), E (+0.333V), G# (+0.667V). Uncommon in electronic music but useful for tension and resolution.

**See also:** Chord, Triad, Interval

### Augmented Interval
**Music Theory:** An interval that is one semitone larger than a major or perfect interval. Example: augmented fourth (tritone) = 6 semitones.

**Synthesis:** Voltage: +0.5V from root. Creates tension and dissonance.

**Frequency:** Tritone ratio approximately 45:32 (or √2:1 in equal temperament).

**See also:** Interval, Tritone, Semitone

## B

### Bar
**Music Theory:** See Measure. A segment of time defined by a specific number of beats. British terminology for what Americans call a "measure."

**See also:** Measure, Time Signature, Beat

### Bass Note
**Music Theory:** The lowest note in a chord or harmonic structure. Determines the chord's inversion and overall stability.

**Synthesis:** Critical in monophonic synthesis - the bass note defines the harmonic foundation. In bassline programming, typically uses root notes or strong chord tones (root, fifth).

**See also:** Root Note, Inversion, Monophonic

### Beat
**Music Theory:** The basic unit of time in music, providing the regular pulse. In 4/4 time, there are four beats per measure.

**Synthesis:** Represented by clock pulses or triggers. Most sequencers and drum machines organize patterns around beat divisions (16th notes, 8th notes, etc.).

**See also:** Tempo, BPM, Clock

### BPM (Beats Per Minute)
**Music Theory:** The tempo measurement indicating how many beats occur in one minute. Common range: 60-180 BPM for most music.

**Synthesis:** Clock rate setting for sequencers, LFOs, and tempo-synced modules. Many modules can sync to external clock for tempo coordination.

**See also:** Tempo, Clock, Beat

### Bridge
**Music Theory:** A contrasting section in a song, typically appearing once between later choruses. Provides variety and often builds tension before the final chorus.

**Synthesis:** Opportunity for dramatic textural or harmonic change. Common techniques: key change, filter sweep, layer addition, or breakdown to minimal elements.

**See also:** Form, Section, Arrangement

## C

### Cadence
**Music Theory:** A harmonic conclusion or resting point at the end of a phrase. Types include authentic (V-I), plagal (IV-I), deceptive (V-vi), and half (ends on V).

**Synthesis:** Important for phrase structure in sequences. In monophonic bass, emphasize cadence points through longer note duration or filter emphasis.

**See also:** Progression, Resolution, Phrase

### Cent
**Music Theory:** A logarithmic unit for measuring musical intervals. 100 cents = 1 semitone, 1200 cents = 1 octave.

**Synthesis:** Fine-tuning measurement. Many oscillators include cent controls for detuning (±50 cents is common). Useful for chorus effects or slight detuning.

**Frequency:** Each cent represents a frequency ratio of 2^(1/1200) ≈ 1.000578.

**See also:** Semitone, Detune, Tuning

### Chord
**Music Theory:** Three or more notes played simultaneously. Basic types include major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads, plus extended chords with 7ths, 9ths, etc.

**Synthesis:** Challenge for monophonic synthesizers - must be implied through arpeggiation, layering multiple oscillators, or using polyphonic modules. Multi-oscillator setups can play chords using voltage offsets.

**See also:** Triad, Harmony, Arpeggio, Polyphonic

### Chord Progression
**Music Theory:** A sequence of chords played in a specific order. Common progressions include I-IV-V-I, I-V-vi-IV, and ii-V-I.

**Synthesis:** In monophonic systems, often represented by bass note sequences following progression roots. Can be programmed into quantizers or sequencers with voltage offsets for chord tones.

**See also:** Progression, Harmony, Cadence

### Chord Tone
**Music Theory:** A note that belongs to a chord (root, third, fifth, seventh, etc.). Provides harmonic stability when used in melody.

**Synthesis:** In monophonic melody programming, emphasize chord tones on strong beats for harmonic clarity. Non-chord tones create tension and movement.

**See also:** Non-Chord Tone, Passing Tone, Melody

### Chromatic Scale
**Music Theory:** A scale containing all twelve semitones within an octave. No notes are skipped - includes every possible pitch in Western music.

**Synthesis:** Important for understanding quantizer programming and oscillator tuning. The full range of 1V/octave standard spans chromatic pitches.

**See also:** Scale, Semitone, Quantizer

### Chorus (Effect)
**Synthesis:** Modulation effect that creates the impression of multiple voices by slightly detuning and delaying copies of the signal. Achieved through LFO-modulated delay lines or multiple slightly-detuned oscillators.

**See also:** Detune, LFO, Modulation

### Chorus (Song Section)
**Music Theory:** The main repeated section of a song, typically containing the hook or most memorable melodic/lyrical content. Usually the highest energy section.

**Synthesis:** Full arrangement with all layers active. Often features emphasized filter cutoff, increased modulation, or additional voices compared to verses.

**See also:** Form, Section, Hook, Arrangement

### Clock
**Synthesis:** Regular timing pulse used to synchronize sequencers, drum machines, and other time-based modules. Common standards: 24 PPQN (pulses per quarter note), DIN Sync, Analog Clock (pulses per step).

**See also:** BPM, Tempo, Sync, Trigger

### Common Tone
**Music Theory:** A note that appears in two successive chords, providing smooth connection between harmonies. Essential for voice leading.

**Synthesis:** In monophonic sequences, repeating or sustaining a note while harmony changes around it. Creates melodic continuity and smooth transitions.

**See also:** Voice Leading, Stepwise Motion, Progression

### Compound Interval
**Music Theory:** An interval larger than an octave. Example: major 9th = octave + major 2nd = 14 semitones.

**Synthesis:** Voltage: 9th = +1.167V (1V octave + 0.167V major 2nd). Used in extended chord voicings and wide-range melodies.

**See also:** Interval, Octave, Extended Chord

### Compound Meter
**Music Theory:** Time signature where each beat subdivides into three parts. Examples: 6/8 (2 beats, each divided into 3 eighth notes), 9/8, 12/8.

**Synthesis:** Program as triplet-based patterns. 6/8 feels like "1-2-3, 4-5-6" rather than six equal beats.

**See also:** Time Signature, Meter, Triplet

### Consonance
**Music Theory:** Stable, harmonious intervals that sound pleasant and resolved. Includes unison, octaves, perfect fifths, and major/minor thirds.

**Synthesis:** Consonant intervals create stable, restful harmonic foundations. Use for resolution points and tonal centers.

**Frequency:** Simple frequency ratios (2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 6:5) create consonance due to minimal beating and overlapping harmonics.

**See also:** Dissonance, Interval, Resolution

### Contrary Motion
**Music Theory:** Voice leading where two melodic lines move in opposite directions - one ascends while the other descends.

**Synthesis:** Strongest voice leading technique. In multi-oscillator setups, program CV sequences that move in opposite directions for smooth, independent lines.

**See also:** Voice Leading, Parallel Motion, Oblique Motion

### CV (Control Voltage)
**Synthesis:** Voltage signal used to control parameters in modular and semi-modular synthesizers. Standard: 1V/octave for pitch, 0-5V or 0-10V for modulation.

**See also:** 1V/Octave, Gate, Trigger, Modulation

### Cycle
**Music Theory:** A complete rotation through a pattern or progression. In jazz, "Cycle of Fifths" progression: I-IV-VII-III-VI-II-V-I.

**Synthesis:** Pattern repetition in sequences. Many sequencers track cycle count for pattern variations or longer-form structures.

**See also:** Progression, Sequence, Pattern
