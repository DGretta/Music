# Progressions

**Moving between chords to create musical narrative**

---

## The Core Concept

A **chord progression** is a sequence of chords that creates harmonic movement and musical narrative. While individual chords create emotional character, progressions create **journey** - tension, release, anticipation, and resolution.

**Why progressions matter:**
- They create forward motion (music that goes somewhere)
- They establish key and tonality (what sounds like "home")
- They provide structure for melodies and arrangements
- They define musical sections (verse, chorus, bridge)
- They're the harmonic foundation of almost all Western music

**The practical reality:** When you program chord changes in a sequencer, you're creating a progression. Understanding progressions means understanding **why certain chord movements feel resolved, tense, or surprising** - and how to use those feelings intentionally.

## Understanding Chord Function

### The Three Harmonic Functions

**In any key, chords have one of three jobs:**

**1. Tonic (Home, Stable, Resolution)**
- Sounds like "home base" or "arrival"
- No tension, feels complete
- Where music starts and ends
- Primary: I chord
- Secondary: vi chord (relative minor)

**2. Dominant (Tension, Wants to Resolve)**
- Creates tension that pulls toward tonic
- Feels unstable, wants to move
- Strong drive toward resolution
- Primary: V chord (or V7)
- Secondary: vii° chord

**3. Subdominant (Preparation, Pre-Tension)**
- Moves away from tonic toward dominant
- Mild tension, transitional feeling
- Sets up dominant function
- Primary: IV chord
- Secondary: ii chord

**The basic cycle:**
```
Tonic → Subdominant → Dominant → Tonic
  I   →     IV      →    V     →   I
(home) → (leaving)  → (tension) → (home)

Musical journey: stable → movement → tension → resolution
```

## Roman Numeral Notation

### Understanding the System

**Roman numerals represent scale degrees and chord quality:**

**In major keys:**
```
Scale degree: 1    2    3    4    5    6    7
Roman numeral: I    ii   iii  IV   V    vi   vii°
Chord quality: Maj  min  min  Maj  Maj  min  dim

Uppercase = Major chord
Lowercase = minor chord
° = diminished
```

**Example in C major:**
```
I   = C major    (C-E-G)
ii  = D minor    (D-F-A)
iii = E minor    (E-G-B)
IV  = F major    (F-A-C)
V   = G major    (G-B-D)
vi  = A minor    (A-C-E)
vii°= B dim      (B-D-F)
```

**Why this system?**
- Works in ANY key (same function, different notes)
- Shows harmonic relationships regardless of key
- Universal language for discussing progressions
- "I-IV-V in G" = G-C-D (same function as C-F-G in C major)

---

## Essential Progressions

### I-IV-V (The Foundation)

**The most fundamental progression in Western music.**

**In C major:**
```
I     IV    V     I
C maj F maj G maj C maj
(home)(away)(tension)(home)
```

**Why it works:**
- I = stable (tonic)
- IV = moves away (subdominant)
- V = creates tension (dominant)
- I = resolves home (tonic)

**Function:**
```
Stability → Movement → Tension → Resolution
```

**Famous examples:**
- "Twist and Shout" (Beatles) - I-IV-V
- "La Bamba" - I-IV-V
- Countless blues, rock, folk songs
- Foundation of 12-bar blues

**In synthesis/sequencing:**
```
Bar 1-2: I chord  (establish home)
Bar 3-4: IV chord (movement away)
Bar 5-6: V chord  (build tension)
Bar 7-8: I chord  (resolve)
```

---

### I-V-vi-IV (The Pop Progression)

**The most popular progression in modern pop music.**

**In C major:**
```
I     V     vi    IV
C maj G maj A min F maj
```

**Why it's everywhere:**
- Moves through multiple functions
- Strong but not overpowering
- Works for verses AND choruses
- Melodically flexible

**Function:**
```
I (tonic) → V (dominant) → vi (relative minor, tonic substitute) → IV (subdominant)
Stable → Tension → Stable-ish → Movement → (loop back to I)
```

**Famous examples:**
- "Don't Stop Believin'" (Journey)
- "Let It Be" (Beatles)
- "No Woman No Cry" (Bob Marley)
- Hundreds of modern pop songs

**Variation: vi-IV-I-V (same chords, different order):**
- "Somebody That I Used to Know" (Gotye)
- Changes the emotional arc (starts minor/sad)

---

### I-vi-IV-V (The '50s Progression)

**Classic doo-wop and early rock progression.**

**In C major:**
```
I     vi    IV    V
C maj A min F maj G maj
```

**Why it works:**
- I to vi = smooth (shares two notes)
- vi to IV = gentle movement
- IV to V = subdominant to dominant (strong pull)
- V back to I = resolution

**Famous examples:**
- "Stand By Me" (Ben E. King)
- "Every Breath You Take" (The Police)
- "Blue Moon"
- Countless doo-wop songs

**Character:** Nostalgic, romantic, smooth, easy-listening

---

### ii-V-I (The Jazz Progression)

**The fundamental progression in jazz harmony.**

**In C major:**
```
ii    V     I
D min G maj C maj
(or Dm7 G7 Cmaj7)
```

**Why it's essential:**
- ii = subdominant function (preparation)
- V = dominant function (tension)
- I = tonic (resolution)
- Strong pull from ii through V to I

**With seventh chords (typical jazz):**
```
Dm7 → G7 → Cmaj7

Dm7:  D-F-A-C     (minor 7)
G7:   G-B-D-F     (dominant 7, contains tritone B-F)
Cmaj7: C-E-G-B    (major 7, stable resolution)
```

**Why seventh chords?**
- G7 contains tritone (B-F) that wants to resolve
- B wants to move up to C (tonic)
- F wants to move down to E (third of tonic)
- Creates strong pull toward resolution

**Famous examples:**
- "Autumn Leaves"
- "Fly Me to the Moon"
- Nearly every jazz standard
- Basis for jazz improvisation

---

### I-bVII-IV (The Modal Progression)

**Common in rock and modal music.**

**In C major (but borrowing from C Mixolydian):**
```
I      bVII   IV
C maj  Bb maj F maj
```

**Why it works:**
- bVII is "borrowed" from parallel minor or Mixolydian mode
- Creates darker, rockier sound than pure major
- Less functional harmony, more modal/atmospheric

**Famous examples:**
- "Sweet Child O' Mine" (Guns N' Roses)
- "Hey Jude" (Beatles)
- Many classic rock songs

**Character:** Rock, anthemic, powerful, less "resolved" than I-IV-V

---

### Minor Key Progressions

**Minor keys have their own common progressions.**

**i-iv-v (Minor version of I-IV-V):**
**In A minor:**
```
i     iv    v
A min D min E min
```

**i-VI-III-VII (Common in modern music):**
**In A minor:**
```
i     VI    III   VII
A min F maj C maj G maj
```

**Famous examples:**
- "Stairway to Heaven" verse (Led Zeppelin)
- Many modern pop/rock songs in minor keys

**Character:** Dark, emotional, dramatic

---

## Cadences (Resolution Patterns)

### What is a Cadence?

**A cadence is a harmonic resolution point - how progressions end phrases or sections.**

### Perfect Cadence (V-I or V7-I)

**The strongest resolution.**

```
V  → I
G  → C (in C major)

Dominant to Tonic = complete resolution
"The End" feeling
```

**Function:** Strong finality, clear ending, traditional closure

**Examples:**
- Ends of songs
- Ends of major sections
- Traditional hymns and classical music

---

### Plagal Cadence (IV-I)

**The "Amen" cadence.**

```
IV → I
F  → C (in C major)

Subdominant to Tonic = gentle resolution
```

**Function:** Softer than perfect cadence, church music feeling

**Famous example:** "Amen" at end of hymns

---

### Half Cadence (ends on V)

**Creates suspension, not resolution.**

```
Any chord → V
(stops on dominant, doesn't resolve)

Creates "comma" not "period"
Unfinished, wants continuation
```

**Function:** Ends a phrase but keeps tension, musical "comma"

**Examples:**
- Ends of verses (before chorus provides resolution)
- Question-and-answer phrasing

---

### Deceptive Cadence (V-vi)

**Surprise resolution.**

```
V  → vi
G  → Am (in C major)

Expects I, gets vi instead
Emotional surprise, continues journey
```

**Function:** Prolongs progression, delays final resolution, adds interest

**Examples:**
- When song seems to end but continues
- Emotional extensions

---

## Progression Building Principles

### Strong vs Weak Movement

**Strong movements (common, functional):**
- V → I (dominant to tonic - strongest)
- IV → I (subdominant to tonic)
- ii → V (subdominant to dominant)
- I → IV (tonic to subdominant)
- I → V (tonic to dominant)

**Weak movements (less common, but usable):**
- I → ii (tonic to subdominant function)
- I → iii (tonic to mediant - rare)
- vi → iii (parallel movement - less common)

**Avoid (usually sounds awkward):**
- V → IV (backwards functionally)
- iii → ii (downward in function)

**The general principle:** Chords want to move in cycles through functions:
```
Tonic → Subdominant → Dominant → Tonic
  or
Tonic → Dominant → Tonic
```

---

### Creating Smooth Voice Leading

**Voice leading = how individual notes move between chords.**

**Good voice leading principles:**
1. **Minimal movement:** Notes move by small intervals (step or stay)
2. **Common tones:** Keep notes that exist in both chords
3. **Contrary motion:** When one voice goes up, another goes down

**Example - smooth voice leading:**
```
C major → F major → G major → C major
E stays  → F (+1)  → G (+1)  → E (-3)
C moves  → C (0)   → B (-1)  → C (+1)
G moves  → A (+1)  → D (-4)  → G (+3)

Notes move by small amounts = smooth
```

**Example - rough voice leading:**
```
C major → F major (1st inv) → G major (2nd inv)
Voices jump around unnecessarily = rough
```

**In synthesis:**
- Program chord inversions that minimize note movement
- Creates smoother, more musical progressions
- Less jarring between chord changes

---

## Progressions in Practice

### Programming Chord Changes

**Sequencer approach:**

**Method 1: Vertical (simultaneous notes):**
```
Bar 1:         Bar 2:         Bar 3:         Bar 4:
Step 1-16      Step 17-32     Step 33-48     Step 49-64
G ●────────    B ●────────    D ●────────    G ●────────
E ●────────    G ●────────    B ●────────    E ●────────
C ●────────    E ●────────    G ●────────    C ●────────
C major        E minor        G major        C major
(I)            (iii)          (V)            (I)
```

**Method 2: Arpeggiated (horizontal):**
```
Bar 1 (C major - I):
Step:  1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8
Note:  C    E    G    E    C    G    E    C

Bar 2 (A minor - vi):
Step:  9    10   11   12   13   14   15   16
Note:  A    C    E    C    A    E    C    A
```

---

### Modular Synthesis Application

**Multi-oscillator chord progression:**

**Bar 1: C major (I)**
```
OSC 1: 0V        (C)
OSC 2: +0.333V   (E)
OSC 3: +0.583V   (G)
```

**Bar 2: F major (IV)**
```
OSC 1: +0.417V   (F)
OSC 2: +0.75V    (A)
OSC 3: +1V       (C, octave up)
```

**Bar 3: G major (V)**
```
OSC 1: +0.583V   (G)
OSC 2: +0.917V   (B)
OSC 3: +1.167V   (D, octave up)
```

**Bar 4: C major (I)**
```
OSC 1: 0V        (C)
OSC 2: +0.333V   (E)
OSC 3: +0.583V   (G)
```

**Result:** I-IV-V-I progression with three oscillators

---

### Using Quantizers for Progressions

**Scale quantizer approach:**

**Challenge:** Most quantizers snap to one scale, making chord changes difficult.

**Solutions:**

**1. Manual scale changes:**
- Bar 1-2: Set quantizer to C major
- Bar 3-4: Change to F major (or use C major, program F chord notes)
- Requires manual switching or automation

**2. Use chromatic quantizer:**
- Quantize to all 12 notes
- Manually program chord tones
- More control, more programming work

**3. Chord-specific quantizers:**
- Some modules quantize to chord tones rather than scales
- Set chord changes externally
- Program root note changes

**The limitation:** Most quantizers are scale-focused, not progression-focused. Chord progressions often require manual note programming or external CV control.

## Progressions for Monophonic Bass

### Bass Lines Outlining Progressions

**A monophonic bass line can outline an entire chord progression.**

**Most synthesizers are monophonic** - but progressions still apply. The bass line implies the harmony by playing strategic notes from each chord.

---

### Root Note Progressions

**The simplest approach: play the root of each chord.**

**I-IV-V-I in C major:**
```
Chords:     I (C maj)  IV (F maj)  V (G maj)  I (C maj)
Bass line:  C          F           G          C

Single notes, but clearly implies progression
Listener's brain fills in the chords
```

**Why this works:**
- Root note is the strongest identifier of a chord
- Establishes harmonic foundation
- Classic bass line technique
- Works with any monophonic instrument

**Example sequence:**
```
Bar 1 (I):   C ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ (whole note)
Bar 2 (IV):  F ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ (whole note)
Bar 3 (V):   G ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ (whole note)
Bar 4 (I):   C ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ (whole note)

Simple, clear, functional
```

---

### Adding Rhythmic Interest

**Static whole notes are boring. Add rhythm.**

**I-IV-V-I with rhythmic variation:**
```
Bar 1 (I):   C ■■ C ■■ C ■■ C ■■ (quarter notes)
Bar 2 (IV):  F ■■■■ F ■■■■ F ■■■■ F ■■■■ (half notes)
Bar 3 (V):   G ■ G ■ G ■ G ■ G ■ G ■ G ■ G ■ (eighth notes, builds energy)
Bar 4 (I):   C ─────────────── (whole note, resolves)

Same progression, rhythmic variety creates interest
```

**Syncopation:**
```
Bar 1 (I):   C ■■ - ■■ - ■■ C ■■ (syncopated)
Bar 2 (IV):  F ■■ F ■■ - ■■ F ■■ (off-beat emphasis)

Off-beat accents create groove
```

---

### Adding Chord Tones

**Root + fifth creates more harmonic information.**

**I-IV-V-I with fifths:**
```
Bar 1 (I - C major):   C → G (root-fifth)
Bar 2 (IV - F major):  F → C (root-fifth)
Bar 3 (V - G major):   G → D (root-fifth)
Bar 4 (I - C major):   C → G (root-fifth)

Two notes per chord, more harmonic clarity
```

**Root + third defines major/minor quality:**
```
Bar 1 (I):   C → E (root-third, shows major)
Bar 2 (IV):  F → A (root-third, shows major)
Bar 3 (V):   G → B (root-third, shows major)
Bar 4 (I):   C → E (root-third, shows major)

Defines chord quality, not just root
```

**Full arpeggios (root-third-fifth):**
```
Bar 1 (I):   C → E → G → E
Bar 2 (IV):  F → A → C → A
Bar 3 (V):   G → B → D → B
Bar 4 (I):   C → E → G → C

Complete chord information in bass line
```

---

### Walking Bass Lines

**Stepwise connection between chord roots.**

**I-IV-V-I walking bass:**
```
Bar 1 (I):   C → D (approach to IV)
Bar 2 (IV):  F → G (approach to V)
Bar 3 (V):   G → F → E → D (descending to I)
Bar 4 (I):   C (resolution)

Smooth stepwise movement between chords
Jazz/blues technique
```

**Chromatic approach:**
```
Bar 1 (I):   C → Db → D → Eb (chromatic climb)
Bar 2 (IV):  F → F# (chromatic approach to G)
Bar 3 (V):   G → F# → F → E (chromatic descent)
Bar 4 (I):   C (resolution)

Half-step movements create smooth connection
```

---

### Common Bass Line Patterns

**Pattern 1: Root on downbeat**
```
Beat:  1    &    2    &    3    &    4    &
Note:  C         C         C         C
       ■         ■         ■         ■

Solid, on-beat, establishes harmony clearly
```

**Pattern 2: Root-fifth alternation**
```
Beat:  1    &    2    &    3    &    4    &
Note:  C    G    C    G    C    G    C    G
       ■    ■    ■    ■    ■    ■    ■    ■

Driving, powerful, emphasizes both root and fifth
Classic disco/house pattern
```

**Pattern 3: Syncopated**
```
Beat:  1    &    2    &    3    &    4    &
Note:  C         C    C              C    C
       ■         ■    ■              ■    ■

Off-beat emphasis creates groove
Funk/R&B technique
```

**Pattern 4: Octave jump**
```
Beat:  1    &    2    &    3    &    4    &
Note:  C         C         C         C
       low       high      low       high

Same root, different octaves
Thick, full, powerful sound
```

### Sequencing Monophonic Progressions

**Practical approach for mono bass sequencers:**

**Step 1: Determine your progression**
```
I-IV-V-I in C major
```

**Step 2: Choose your pattern**
```
Root-fifth alternation (simple, effective)
```

**Step 3: Program each bar**
```
Bar 1 (16 steps, I):  C-G-C-G-C-G-C-G-C-G-C-G-C-G-C-G
Bar 2 (16 steps, IV): F-C-F-C-F-C-F-C-F-C-F-C-F-C-F-C
Bar 3 (16 steps, V):  G-D-G-D-G-D-G-D-G-D-G-D-G-D-G-D
Bar 4 (16 steps, I):  C-G-C-G-C-G-C-G-C-G-C-G-C-G-C-G
```

**Step 4: Add variation**
```
Vary rhythm, gate lengths, octaves
Add fills on bar 4
Create version for verse, different for chorus
```

### TB-303 Style Bass Lines

**The classic acid bass technique:**

**Characteristics:**
- Root-heavy with occasional fifths and octaves
- Syncopated (off-beat accents)
- Slides between notes
- Filter automation follows rhythm

**I-IV-V-I acid bass:**
```
Bar 1 (I):   C → - → C → G → C (slide) → C
Bar 2 (IV):  F → F → - → C → F (slide) → F
Bar 3 (V):   G → - → G → D → G → -
Bar 4 (I):   C → C → G → - → C (slide) → C

- = rest
(slide) = glide/portamento between notes
Syncopated, energetic, classic 303 feel
```

---

### Why Progressions Matter for Mono Bass

**Even with one note at a time:**

1. **You're outlining chords** (arpeggio or root emphasis)
2. **You're creating harmonic movement** (progression feels)
3. **You're establishing key** (tonic function)
4. **You're supporting other elements** (melody, drums)
5. **You're telling the harmonic story** (tension/release)

**Bottom line:** A monophonic bass line playing the right notes at the right time can imply an entire chord progression. Understanding progressions helps you choose which notes to play.

---

## Common Confusions Addressed

### "Can I use any chords in any order?"

**Technically yes, practically no.**

**Random chord order usually sounds incoherent:**
```
I → iii → vii° → ii → vi → IV
Lacks direction, no clear function
```

**Functional order sounds purposeful:**
```
I → IV → V → I
Clear journey: home → away → tension → resolution
```

**The principle:** Chords want to move through harmonic functions (tonic → subdominant → dominant → tonic). Fighting this creates tension (which can be good) but randomness creates confusion.

---

### "Do progressions have to resolve to I?"

**No, but it creates the most complete feeling.**

**Songs can:**
- End on V (half cadence - leaves tension)
- Loop without resolving (many electronic tracks)
- End on vi (deceptive, less final)
- Stay ambiguous (modal music)

**But most Western music eventually resolves to tonic for finality.**

---

### "Why do some progressions sound 'overused'?"

**Because they work really well.**

**I-V-vi-IV is everywhere because:**
- Strong harmonic movement
- Works for multiple emotions
- Easy to sing over
- Familiar = accessible

**This isn't bad.** Familiar progressions work. Innovation comes from:
- What you do with the progression (melody, rhythm, production)
- Variations (inversions, extensions, rhythmic variation)
- Combining familiar and unfamiliar elements

---

### "What about modal progressions and borrowed chords?"

**Those are advanced topics (Integration Layer).**

**For foundation understanding:**
- Master diatonic progressions first (chords from one scale)
- Understand functional harmony (tonic/subdominant/dominant)
- Get comfortable with common progressions

**Later:**
- Modal interchange (borrowing from parallel modes)
- Secondary dominants (temporary key changes)
- Chromatic mediants (non-functional jumps)

---

## Try This (If You Want)

### Exercise 1: Progression Recognition

**Goal:** Train your ear to recognize common progressions.

**How:**
1. Listen to pop songs and try to identify I-V-vi-IV
2. Listen for the emotional arc: stable → tension → stable-ish → movement
3. Once you recognize this progression, you'll hear it everywhere
4. Try with other common progressions (I-IV-V, ii-V-I)

**What you'll discover:**
- Most pop music uses 3-5 common progressions
- Recognizing progressions helps you understand song structure
- The same progression can sound different with varied rhythm/melody

**Not feeling it?** Just notice when music feels "resolved" vs "tense" - that's functional harmony at work.

---

### Exercise 2: Program a Progression

**Goal:** Create a functional progression in your sequencer (requires chord-capable setup).

**How:**
1. Choose a key (C major for simplicity)
2. Program 4-bar progression: I-IV-V-I
3. Use inversions to minimize voice movement
4. Listen to the journey: stable → away → tension → home
5. Try variations (I-vi-IV-V, I-V-vi-IV)

**What you'll discover:**
- Even simple progressions create emotional narrative
- Inversions affect smoothness between chords
- The same chords in different orders = different feelings
- Four bars can be a complete musical phrase

**Alternative:** Use a chord generator plugin and change chords every 2-4 bars, focus on functional movement.

---

### Exercise 3: Analyze a Favorite Song

**Goal:** Reverse-engineer a progression from a song you like.

**How:**
1. Pick a simple song (4-chord songs are best for starting)
2. Find the key (what note feels like "home"?)
3. Identify each chord (major or minor?)
4. Convert to Roman numerals (I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii°)
5. Notice the functional movement

**What you'll discover:**
- Most songs use common progressions with variations
- Understanding progressions demystifies songwriting
- You can recreate similar feelings in your own music

**Not feeling it?** Just be aware that most music uses chord progressions, and they create the emotional foundation you're hearing.

## Connections to Other Concepts

**This concept connects to:**

→ **[Chords](01_chords_basics.md)** *(Previous Topic)*
Progressions are sequences of chords. Understanding individual chords is essential for understanding how they move.

→ **[Basic Scales](../01_foundation/03_scales_basics.md)** *(Foundation)*
Diatonic progressions use chords built from scale degrees. Same scale = related chords.

→ **[Melody Construction](03_melody_basics.md)** *(Coming Soon)*
Melodies are built over chord progressions. Understanding progressions helps create melodies that fit harmonically.

→ **[Form and Arrangement](../03_integration/form_arrangement.md)** *(Coming Soon)*
Different sections (verse, chorus, bridge) often use different progressions or variations.

→ **[Voice Leading](../03_integration/voice_leading.md)** *(Coming Soon)*
Smooth progressions require good voice leading - efficient movement between chord tones.

## What You Should Remember

**Core understanding:**
- Progressions are sequences of chords that create harmonic narrative
- Chords have functions: tonic (stable), subdominant (movement), dominant (tension)
- Roman numerals show chord function regardless of key
- Certain movements are strong (V-I), others weak or awkward

**Essential progressions:**
- **I-IV-V:** Foundation of Western music, blues, rock
- **I-V-vi-IV:** Most common pop progression
- **I-vi-IV-V:** Classic '50s progression
- **ii-V-I:** Essential jazz progression

**Practical application:**
- Programming chord changes in sequencers
- Understanding when music feels resolved vs tense
- Creating emotional narrative through harmonic movement
- Choosing chord orders that support musical intention

**What you don't need to memorize:**
- Every possible progression in every key
- All cadence types and names
- Complex voice leading rules initially
- Modal progressions and borrowed chords (advanced topics)

**What matters:**
Understanding that progressions create journey, not just static harmony. Certain chord movements create specific emotional effects. Using functional harmony creates music that feels purposeful rather than random.
