# Melody Construction

**Creating intentional melodic lines that work with harmony**

---

## The Core Concept

A **melody** is a sequence of single notes that creates a musical line - the part you hum, whistle, or sing. While harmony (chords and progressions) provides the emotional foundation, melody is what people **remember**.

**Why melody matters:**
- It's the most memorable element of music (the "hook")
- It creates the foreground while harmony creates the background
- It tells a musical story through pitch and rhythm
- It's essential for leads, bass lines, vocal lines, and main themes

**The practical reality:** When you program a sequence of notes, you're creating a melody. Understanding melody construction means understanding **why certain note sequences feel complete, memorable, and musical** rather than random.

## Melody and Harmony: The Relationship

### Chord Tones vs Non-Chord Tones

**Every note in a melody has a relationship to the underlying harmony.**

**Chord tones (stable):**
- Notes that belong to the current chord
- Sound stable, strong, resolved
- Good landing points for phrases
- Can be held longer without tension

**Non-chord tones (passing, tension):**
- Notes that don't belong to the current chord
- Create movement and interest
- Usually brief (passing between chord tones)
- Create tension that resolves

**Example - C major chord (C-E-G) underneath:**
```
Melody note: C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C
Relation:    CT -- CT -- CT -- -- CT
             |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
             Strong Weak Strong Weak Strong Weak Weak Strong

CT = Chord Tone (stable)
-- = Non-chord tone (passing)
```

**In practice:**
```
Over C major chord:
Note  ║ 
  C   ║ ●───────        ← Chord tone (stable, can hold)
  B   ║         ●       ← Non-chord tone (passing, brief)
  A   ║           ●     ← Non-chord tone (passing, brief)
  G   ║             ●── ← Chord tone (stable, can hold)
      ║
Strong notes on beats, passing tones connect them
```

---

## Melodic Contour (Shape)

### What is Contour?

**Contour is the overall shape of a melody - how it moves through pitch space.**

**Basic contour shapes:**

**Ascending (upward movement):**
```
Pitch
  ↑         ●
            ●
          ●
        ●
      ●
    → Time
    
Tension increases, energy builds
Examples: verse building to chorus, question phrases
```

**Descending (downward movement):**
```
Pitch
  ↑   ●
      ●
        ●
          ●
            ●
    → Time
    
Tension releases, energy settles
Examples: answers, resolutions, endings
```

**Arch (up then down):**
```
Pitch
  ↑       ●
        ●   ●
      ●       ●
    ●           ●
    → Time
    
Rise to climax, then release
Most common melodic shape - natural and satisfying
Examples: most memorable melodies, phrases
```

**Inverted arch (down then up):**
```
Pitch
  ↑ ●           ●
      ●       ●
        ●   ●
          ●
    → Time
    
Dip then rise - less common but useful
Creates different emotional arc
```

**Wave (alternating):**
```
Pitch
  ↑     ●       ●
      ●   ●   ●   ●
    ●       ●       ●
    → Time
    
Up and down motion - creates movement
Good for verses, continuous sections
```

---

## Stepwise Motion vs Leaps

### The Balance

**Good melodies balance smooth movement (steps) with dramatic movement (leaps).**

**Stepwise motion (1-2 semitones):**
- Smooth, singable, easy to follow
- Creates connection and flow
- Too much = boring, predictable
- **Most melodies are primarily stepwise**

```
C → D → E → F → E → D → C
All steps (1-2 semitones) - smooth but potentially dull
```

**Leaps (3+ semitones):**
- Dramatic, attention-grabbing
- Creates interest and surprise
- Too much = difficult to sing, disjointed
- **Used strategically for emphasis**

```
C → G → C → E
Leaps create drama and interest
```

**Balanced example:**
```
C → D → E → G → F → E → D → C
Steps-step-leap-step-step-step-step

Mostly stepwise with one strategic leap (E→G)
Singable but interesting
```

---

### Leap Resolution

**After a large leap, melodies usually move by step in the opposite direction.**

**Why:** The leap creates tension, stepwise motion resolves it.

**Example:**
```
Note  ║ 
  G   ║       ●───        ← Leap up to G
  F   ║             ●     ← Step down (resolves)
  E   ║               ●── ← Continues stepwise
  D   ║ 
  C   ║ ●───              ← Starting point
      ║
Leap: C→G (+7 semitones)
Resolution: G→F→E (stepwise descent)
```

**Rule of thumb:** Big leap? Follow with small steps in the opposite direction.

---

## Melodic Rhythm

### Rhythm is Part of Melody

**The same notes with different rhythm = different melody.**

**Example - same pitches, different rhythm:**

**Version 1 (even rhythm):**
```
Note:  C    E    G    E    C
Gate:  ▄▄▄▄ ▄▄▄▄ ▄▄▄▄ ▄▄▄▄ ▄▄▄▄
       Even, mechanical, less interesting
```

**Version 2 (varied rhythm):**
```
Note:  C    E    G         E    C
Gate:  ▄▄   ▄▄   ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄  ▄▄   ▄▄▄▄
       Short short long     short long
       More phrasing, more musical
```

**Principles:**
- **Vary note lengths** - mix short and long notes
- **Use rests** - silence is part of phrasing
- **Emphasize important notes** - longer duration = more weight
- **Create rhythmic patterns** - repetition with variation

---

## Phrasing and Repetition

### Musical Phrases

**A phrase is a complete musical thought - like a sentence in language.**

**Typical phrase structure:**

**Question-Answer (Call-Response):**
```
Question phrase (bars 1-2):
C → E → G → A (ends with tension, unresolved)

Answer phrase (bars 3-4):
G → F → E → C (resolves, completes the thought)
```

**AA'B structure (statement-variation-contrast):**
```
A:  Original phrase (bars 1-2)
A': Same phrase with slight variation (bars 3-4)
B:  Contrasting phrase (bars 5-6)
A'' Return to original (bars 7-8)
```

---

### Repetition (The Memory Maker)

**Memorable melodies repeat with variation.**

**Exact repetition:**
```
Bar 1: C-E-G-E-C
Bar 2: C-E-G-E-C (exactly the same)
Good for establishing pattern, but can be boring if overused
```

**Rhythmic repetition (different notes, same rhythm):**
```
Bar 1: C  E  G  E (quarter-quarter-quarter-quarter)
Bar 2: D  F  A  F (same rhythm, different pitches)
```

**Melodic repetition (same notes, different rhythm):**
```
Bar 1: C-E-G (even quarters)
Bar 2: C-E-G (syncopated)
```

**Sequence (repetition at different pitch level):**
```
Bar 1: C-D-E
Bar 2: D-E-F# (same intervals, starting higher)
Bar 3: E-F#-G# (continues the pattern)
```

**Why repetition works:**
- Creates familiarity and expectation
- Makes melodies memorable
- Provides structure and cohesion
- Variation keeps it interesting

---

## Range and Tessitura

### Melodic Range

**Range = the distance between lowest and highest note.**

**Comfortable singing range:** About one octave (12 semitones)
**Extended range:** Up to 1.5 octaves (18 semitones)
**Very wide range:** 2+ octaves (24+ semitones) - harder to sing

**Programming consideration:**
- Vocal melodies: Keep within singable range
- Instrumental melodies: Can use wider range
- Bass lines: Usually stay in lower octave
- Lead synths: Can exploit wide range

---

### Tessitura (Average Height)

**Tessitura = where the melody generally sits, not just its extreme notes.**

**High tessitura:**
```
Most notes in upper register
Creates tension, brightness, excitement
Hard to sustain (tiring for singers)
```

**Middle tessitura:**
```
Most notes in middle register
Comfortable, balanced, conversational
Most common for verses
```

**Low tessitura:**
```
Most notes in lower register
Dark, serious, grounded
Good for bass lines, male vocals in low register
```

**Varying tessitura creates contrast:**
- Verse: Middle tessitura (comfortable, conversational)
- Chorus: High tessitura (excited, emphasized)
- Bridge: Low tessitura (contrast, depth)

---

## Melody Construction Techniques

### Starting and Ending Points

**Strong starting points:**
- **Root (1st degree):** Most stable, clear tonic
- **Third (3rd degree):** Also stable, establishes major/minor
- **Fifth (5th degree):** Strong, decisive
- Upbeat (before the downbeat): Creates forward motion

**Strong ending points:**
- **Root (1st degree):** Most final, complete resolution
- **Third (3rd degree):** Softer ending, still resolved
- Avoid ending on non-chord tones (sounds unfinished)
- End on strong beats (downbeats) for finality

---

### Climax Point

**Most melodies have one peak moment - the climax.**

**Placement:**
- Usually around 2/3 through the phrase
- Often the highest note
- Given rhythmic emphasis (longer duration or strong beat)
- Creates emotional peak

**Example:**
```
Note  ║ 
  A   ║                   ●────  ← Climax (highest, longest)
  G   ║             ●
  F   ║       ●                 ●
  E   ║                           ●
  D   ║ ●   ●                       ●
  C   ║                               ●──
      ║─┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼
Bar:  ║ 1   1   2   2   3   3   4   4

Builds to climax at bar 3, then resolves
```

---

### Approach Tones

**Notes that lead to important target notes.**

**Leading tone approach (one semitone below):**
```
Target: C
Approach: B → C (strong pull upward)
Creates expectation and resolution
```

**Upper neighbor approach (one semitone above):**
```
Target: C
Approach: C# → C (pulls downward)
Less common but effective
```

**Chromatic approach (half-step from either direction):**
```
Target: E
Approach: Eb → E (chromatic, jazzy)
or:       F → E
```

**Why approach tones work:**
- Create expectation (ear predicts where you're going)
- Emphasize important notes (the targets)
- Add sophistication and interest

---

## Melody Over Progressions

### Following the Harmony

**Melodies must relate to the underlying chord progression.**

**Example: I-vi-IV-V progression in C major**

**Bar 1 (C major - I):**
```
Chord: C-E-G
Good melody notes: C, E, G (chord tones)
Passing notes: D, F, A, B (connect chord tones)

Melody: C → E → G → E
All chord tones, very stable
```

**Bar 2 (A minor - vi):**
```
Chord: A-C-E
Good melody notes: A, C, E (chord tones)
Passing notes: B, D, F, G

Melody: A → G → F → E
Mix of chord tones (A, E) and passing (G, F)
```

**Principle:** Melody outlines the harmony while adding its own movement.

---

### Chord Tone on Strong Beats

**Place chord tones on strong beats (downbeats), passing tones on weak beats.**

**Example over C major chord:**
```
Beat:      1    &    2    &    3    &    4    &
Melody:    C    D    E    F    G    A    G    F
Chord:     CT   --   CT   --   CT   --   CT   --
Strength:  ↑         ↑         ↑         ↑

Strong beats = chord tones (C, E, G, G)
Weak beats = passing tones (D, F, A, F)
```

**Why this works:**
- Strong beats emphasize stable notes (chord tones)
- Weak beats allow movement (passing tones)
- Creates tension and resolution within the measure

---

## Melody in Practice

### Programming Lead Lines

**Sequencer approach:**

**Step 1: Establish chord progression**
```
Bars 1-2: C major
Bars 3-4: F major
Bars 5-6: G major
Bars 7-8: C major
```

**Step 2: Outline harmony with chord tones**
```
Bar 1-2 (C maj): C → E → G → E
Bar 3-4 (F maj): F → A → C → A
Bar 5-6 (G maj): G → B → D → B
Bar 7-8 (C maj): C → E → G → C
```

**Step 3: Add passing tones**
```
Bar 1-2 (C maj): C → D → E → F → G → F → E → D
Bar 3-4 (F maj): F → G → A → B → C → B → A → G
(etc.)
```

**Step 4: Add rhythmic variation**
```
Vary note lengths, add rests, create phrasing
Use gates to create articulation
```

---

### Bass Line Construction

**Bass lines are melodies too - just in the low register.**

**Principles:**
- Emphasize root notes on beat 1 (establishes harmony)
- Use chord tones primarily (root, third, fifth)
- Stepwise motion or strategic leaps
- Rhythmic interest (not just whole notes)

**Example bass line for I-IV-V-I:**
```
Bar 1 (C major):
Beat:  1    2    3    4
Note:  C    E    G    E
       Root 3rd  5th  3rd

Bar 2 (F major):
Beat:  1    2    3    4
Note:  F    C    A    C
       Root 5th  3rd  5th
```

---

### Using Quantizers for Melody

**Scale quantization helps melodic programming:**

**Setup:**
```
Random source → Quantizer (set to scale) → Oscillator
```

**What happens:**
- Random voltages → Notes in chosen scale
- All notes are "correct" (in key)
- Still sounds musical (no wrong notes)
- But lacks intentional phrasing

**Enhancement:**
```
Sequenced voltages → Quantizer → Oscillator

Program intentional contour
Quantizer ensures notes stay in scale
Combines intentional shape with scale constraint
```

**Limitation:** Quantizers ensure pitch correctness but don't create phrasing, rhythm, or contour. Those require intentional programming.

---

## Common Confusions Addressed

### "Do I have to use chord tones?"

**No, but they provide stability.**

**All chord tones:**
- Very stable, sometimes boring
- Good for establishing harmony clearly
- Safe for beginners

**Mix of chord tones and passing tones:**
- More interesting, natural movement
- How most melodies actually work
- Requires understanding which notes are passing

**Mostly non-chord tones:**
- Very tense, experimental
- Can sound "wrong" if not handled carefully
- Advanced technique (chromaticism, outside playing)

**Rule of thumb:** Land on chord tones on strong beats, pass through other notes on weak beats.

---

### "Why does my melody sound random?"

**Common causes:**
1. **Too many leaps:** All large intervals = disjointed
2. **No repetition:** Every note different = unmemorable
3. **No phrase structure:** No beginning/middle/end
4. **No relationship to harmony:** Melody ignores chord changes
5. **No rhythmic pattern:** Every note same length

**Solutions:**
- Use mostly stepwise motion
- Repeat phrases with variation
- Create question-answer structure
- Land on chord tones at phrase points
- Vary rhythm - mix short and long notes

---

### "Can melodies change scales?"

**Yes - when the harmony changes keys (modulation).**

**Example:**
```
Bars 1-4: C major scale, I-IV-V progression
Bars 5-8: A minor scale, i-iv-v progression

Melody shifts to match the new key
```

**But within one key/section:** Stay in the chosen scale for coherence.

---

### "What about blue notes and chromatic passing tones?"

**Those are advanced techniques (Integration Layer).**

**For foundation understanding:**
- Master diatonic melodies first (within one scale)
- Understand chord tone relationships
- Get comfortable with basic phrasing

**Later:**
- Chromatic passing tones (non-scale notes connecting scale notes)
- Blue notes (expressive pitch bending, blues scale)
- Outside playing (intentionally going "outside" the scale)

---

## Try This (If You Want)

### Exercise 1: Melody Recognition and Analysis

**Goal:** Understand how melodies relate to harmony.

**How:**
1. Pick a simple song (nursery rhyme, pop hook)
2. Identify the underlying chords
3. Notice which melody notes are chord tones vs passing tones
4. Observe the contour (arch? ascending? wave?)
5. Notice the phrasing (question-answer? repetition?)

**What you'll discover:**
- Most melodies use primarily chord tones on strong beats
- Memorable melodies have clear contour and repetition
- Good melodies balance stepwise motion with strategic leaps

**Not feeling it?** Just notice the melody vs the harmony when listening to music. They work together.

---

### Exercise 2: Program a Melodic Sequence

**Goal:** Create an intentional melody over a chord progression (requires sequencer).

**How:**
1. Program simple progression: C-F-G-C (I-IV-V-I)
2. Program melody using mostly chord tones:
   - Bar 1 (C major): C-E-G-E
   - Bar 2 (F major): F-A-C-A
   - Bar 3 (G major): G-B-D-B
   - Bar 4 (C major): C-E-G-C
3. Add passing tones between chord tones
4. Vary rhythm (not all quarter notes)
5. Create arch contour (build to climax, then descend)

**What you'll discover:**
- Chord tones sound stable, passing tones create movement
- Contour creates emotional arc
- Rhythm is as important as pitch
- Simple melodies can be effective

---

### Exercise 3: Contour Exploration

**Goal:** Understand how shape affects emotion (requires pitch control).

**How:**
1. Program ascending line: C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C
   - Listen: builds tension, energetic, questioning
2. Program descending line: C-B-A-G-F-E-D-C
   - Listen: releases tension, settling, answering
3. Program arch: C-E-G-C-G-E-C
   - Listen: natural, satisfying, complete
4. Program wave: C-E-D-F-E-G-F-A
   - Listen: flowing, continuous, evolving

**What you'll discover:**
- Direction creates emotional meaning
- Arch shape feels most natural and satisfying
- Contour is as important as the actual notes

**Not feeling it?** Just be aware that melodies move in shapes, and those shapes have emotional meaning.

## Connections to Other Concepts

**This concept connects to:**

→ **[Intervals](../01_foundation/02_intervals_basics.md)** *(Foundation)*
Melodies are sequences of intervals. Stepwise = small intervals, leaps = large intervals.

→ **[Basic Scales](../01_foundation/03_scales_basics.md)** *(Foundation)*
Melodies use notes from scales. Staying in scale = coherent melody.

→ **[Simple Rhythm](../01_foundation/04_rhythm_basics.md)** *(Foundation)*
Melodic rhythm is as important as pitch. Same notes, different rhythm = different melody.

→ **[Chords](01_chords_basics.md)** *(Application)*
Melodies relate to underlying chords. Chord tones = stable, passing tones = movement.

→ **[Progressions](02_progressions_basics.md)** *(Application)*
Melodies follow chord progressions. Good melodies outline the harmonic movement.

→ **[Voice Leading](../03_integration/voice_leading.md)** *(Coming Soon)*
When multiple melodies play together, voice leading principles apply.

## What You Should Remember

**Core understanding:**
- Melodies are sequences of single notes creating a musical line
- Chord tones sound stable, non-chord tones create movement
- Good melodies balance stepwise motion with strategic leaps
- Contour (shape) creates emotional arc
- Repetition with variation makes melodies memorable

**Essential principles:**
- **Chord tones on strong beats** for stability
- **Mostly stepwise motion** for singability
- **Strategic leaps** for interest (then resolve by step)
- **Clear phrasing** with beginning/middle/end
- **Varied rhythm** - not all notes same length

**Practical application:**
- Programming lead lines that outline harmony
- Creating bass lines with root emphasis
- Using scale quantization as foundation
- Balancing stability (chord tones) with movement (passing tones)
- Creating memorable hooks through repetition

**What you don't need to memorize:**
- Every possible contour shape
- Complex chromatic approaches (advanced)
- All phrasing structures (question-answer is enough to start)
- Outside playing techniques (Integration Layer)

**What matters:**
Understanding that melodies aren't random note sequences - they have shape, rhythm, phrasing, and relationship to harmony. Good melodies create musical narrative that people remember.
