# Music Theory Reference

**Quick lookup materials for synthesis and music production**

---

## About This Reference Section

This is the **Reference Layer** - quick lookup tables, charts, and formulas for all music theory concepts covered in the curriculum. These materials are designed for **fast reference while working**, not teaching from scratch.

**When to use these references:**
- You understand the concept but need specific details
- You're working on a track and need quick lookup
- You want to see all options at once (all scales, all chords, etc.)
- You need voltage/frequency calculations for modular
- You want progression templates or voice leading examples

**When to use teaching modules instead:**
- You're learning a concept for the first time
- You want to understand WHY something works
- You need exercises and practical examples
- You want connections between concepts
