## G

### Gate
**Synthesis:** A control signal that indicates when a note should be on or off. High voltage = note on, low/zero voltage = note off. Works in tandem with CV for complete note information.

**See also:** Trigger, CV, Duration, Envelope

### Glide
**Synthesis:** See Portamento. Gradual pitch transition between notes rather than instant change. Creates smooth, sliding effect.

**See also:** Portamento, Legato

### Grace Note
**Music Theory:** A quick ornamental note played immediately before the main note. Takes time from either the preceding note or the main note itself.

**Synthesis:** Very short gate on grace note, immediately followed by main note. Often programmed as fast sequence or ratcheting.

**See also:** Ornament, Ratchet

### Half Note
**Music Theory:** A note lasting two beats in 4/4 time, or half the duration of a whole note. Notated as an open notehead with a stem.

**Synthesis:** In 16-step sequencer at 120 BPM, half note = 4 steps.

**See also:** Note Value, Quarter Note, Whole Note

### Half Step
**Music Theory:** The smallest interval in Western music, equal to one semitone. On piano, the distance from any key to the very next key.

**Synthesis:** Voltage: 0.083V (1/12 volt). The basic building block of the 1V/octave standard.

**See also:** Semitone, Whole Step, Chromatic Scale

### Harmonic
**Physics/Synthesis:** A frequency that is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. 2nd harmonic = 2x fundamental, 3rd = 3x, etc. Determines timbre.

**See also:** Overtone, Fundamental, Harmonic Series, Timbre

### Harmonic Minor Scale
**Music Theory:** A minor scale with a raised seventh degree. Formula: W-H-W-W-H-W+H-H (whole-half-whole-whole-half-whole+half-half). Creates distinctive augmented 2nd interval between 6th and 7th degrees.

**Synthesis:** Voltage pattern in C harmonic minor: 0V, +0.167V, +0.25V, +0.417V, +0.583V, +0.667V, +0.917V. Used in classical and metal contexts.

**See also:** Minor Scale, Natural Minor, Melodic Minor

### Harmonic Series
**Physics/Synthesis:** The sequence of frequencies that are integer multiples of a fundamental: f, 2f, 3f, 4f, 5f, etc. Natural resonances of vibrating objects.

**Frequency:** If fundamental = 100 Hz, harmonics are 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz, 500 Hz, etc.

**See also:** Harmonic, Overtone, Fundamental, Timbre

### Harmony
**Music Theory:** The simultaneous sounding of notes to create chords and chord progressions. The vertical aspect of music (as opposed to melody's horizontal aspect).

**Synthesis:** In monophonic systems, implied through arpeggiation, bass note selection, or multi-oscillator voicing.

**See also:** Chord, Progression, Melody

### Hertz (Hz)
**Physics/Synthesis:** Unit of frequency measurement = cycles per second. Standard pitch reference: A4 = 440 Hz.

**See also:** Frequency, Pitch, A440

### Hook
**Music Theory:** A memorable musical phrase or riff that "hooks" the listener's attention. Often the most recognizable element of a song, typically in the chorus.

**Synthesis:** Emphasize hooks through prominent filter settings, distinctive timbres, or repetition. Often the main sequence or melodic motif.

**See also:** Melody, Riff, Chorus

## I

### Interval
**Music Theory:** The distance between two pitches, measured in semitones or scale degrees. Basic intervals: unison, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, octave.

**Synthesis:** Each semitone = 0.083V in 1V/octave standard. Understanding intervals is essential for chord programming and melody construction.

**See also:** Semitone, Scale Degree, Consonance, Dissonance

### Intro (Introduction)
**Music Theory:** The opening section of a song, establishing mood, tempo, and often key. Typically leads into verse or main theme.

**Synthesis:** Often features reduced arrangement, building layers, filter sweeps, or ambient texture. Sets sonic palette for the track.

**See also:** Form, Section, Arrangement

### Inversion (Chord)
**Music Theory:** Rearrangement of chord tones so that a note other than the root is in the bass. First inversion = third in bass, second inversion = fifth in bass.

**Synthesis:** Changes voltage relationships. C major (C-E-G): root position = 0V, +0.333V, +0.583V. First inversion (E-G-C) = 0V, +0.25V, +0.667V from E.

**See also:** Chord, Voicing, Bass Note

### Inversion (Interval)
**Music Theory:** Flipping an interval so the lower note becomes the higher note (or vice versa). A major 3rd inverted becomes a minor 6th. Sum of interval and its inversion = 9 (octave).

**Synthesis:** Useful for creating mirror melodies or contrary motion. Ascending major 3rd (+0.333V) inverted = descending minor 6th (-0.667V from starting point).

**See also:** Interval, Contrary Motion

### Inversion (Melodic)
**Music Theory:** A composition technique where a melody is flipped upward/downward intervals become downward/upward. If original melody goes up a 3rd, inversion goes down a 3rd.

**Synthesis:** Can be programmed using CV processors that multiply CV by -1, or manually programming the mirror image of a sequence.

**See also:** Melody, Contrary Motion, Retrograde
