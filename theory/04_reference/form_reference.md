## Arrangement Techniques

### Layering and Texture

**Sparse (minimal texture):**
```
Elements: 2-4
Frequency range: Limited
Space: Lots of gaps
Feel: Minimal, focused, intimate

Example:
- Kick drum
- Bass line
- One pad or melody
```

**Medium (balanced texture):**
```
Elements: 5-8
Frequency range: Well-distributed
Space: Balanced
Feel: Full but clear

Example:
- Kick
- Bass
- Hi-hats
- Pad/chord
- Lead melody
- Percussion fill
```

**Dense (thick texture):**
```
Elements: 9+
Frequency range: Full spectrum
Space: Very filled
Feel: Wall of sound, overwhelming

Example:
- Full drum kit
- Multiple bass layers
- Multiple percussion
- Pad layers
- Multiple melodic elements
- Effects and ear candy
```

**Principle:** Contrast sparse and dense for impact

---

### Frequency Spectrum Allocation

**Organize elements across frequency spectrum:**

**Sub (20-60 Hz):**
- Sub bass
- Kick drum fundamental

**Bass (60-250 Hz):**
- Bass line
- Kick body
- Low toms

**Low-mid (250-500 Hz):**
- Toms
- Low synth pads
- Bass upper harmonics

**Mid (500-2000 Hz):**
- Snare
- Lead vocals/melody
- Chord mid-range

**High-mid (2000-6000 Hz):**
- Hi-hats
- Cymbals
- Vocal presence

**High (6000-20000 Hz):**
- Air/shimmer
- Cymbal sizzle
- Harmonic sparkle

**Principle:** Fill spectrum without crowding any range

## Build Techniques

### Electronic Build-Up Methods

**Filter Sweep:**
```
Bars 1-4: Low-pass filter closed (dark)
Bars 5-8: Gradually opening (brightening)
Bar 8: Fully open (bright), drop hits

Creates tension through harmonic content
```

**Layer Addition:**
```
Bar 1: Kick only
Bar 2: Add bass
Bar 3: Add hi-hats
Bar 4: Add clap
Bar 5: Add percussion
Bar 6: Add synth
Bar 7: Add effects
Bar 8: All elements, drop

Progressive layering builds energy
```

**Risers:**
```
Bars 1-7: White noise riser, pitch rising
Bar 8: Drop (riser stops)

Creates anticipation and tension
Very common in EDM
```

**Drum Fills:**
```
Bars 1-6: Steady beat
Bar 7: Increasingly dense fills
Bar 8: Drop

Rhythmic acceleration builds energy
```

**Silence:**
```
Bars 1-6: Building with all techniques
Bar 7: Continue build
Bar 8, beat 3-4: SILENCE
Bar 9: DROP

Silence before drop increases impact
```

---

### Drop Techniques

**Maximum Impact:**
```
All elements return simultaneously
Kick hits hard on "the one"
Bass at maximum
Brightest filter settings
Fullest arrangement
```

**Energy Maintenance:**
```
Bars 1-8: Full energy (main hook)
Bars 9-16: Slight variation (maintain interest)
Bars 17-24: Further variation or breakdown
```

---

## Practical Arrangement Tips

### Section Contrast

**Create contrast through:**

Chorus: Full (drums, bass, pads, leads)
```

**Dynamics:**
```
Verse: Quiet
Chorus: Loud
```

**Harmonic complexity:**
```
Verse: Simple (I-vi-IV-V)
Chorus: More complex (add sevenths, substitutions)
```

**Rhythm:**
```
Verse: Steady, predictable
Chorus: More active, fills
```

**Frequency content:**
```
Verse: Dark (closed filter)
Chorus: Bright (open filter)
```

---

### Transition Techniques

**Between sections:**

**Fill:**
```
Last bar of section: Drum fill
Signals change coming
```

**Riser:**
```
Last 2-4 bars: Rising effect
Builds anticipation
```

**Filter sweep:**
```
Last bar: Filter closes or opens
Prepares new sonic space
```

**Silence/pause:**
```
Beat 3-4 of last bar: Silence
Creates impact on next section
```

---

### Variation Techniques

**Repeat with changes:**

**Second verse variation:**
```
Add:
- More percussion
- Doubled melody
- Harmony vocals
- Pad layer
```

**Second chorus variation:**
```
Add:
- Extra harmonies
- Counter-melodies
- Rhythmic fills
- Brighter sounds
```

**Third chorus (climax):**
```
Add:
- Key change (up half or whole step)
- Extra layers
- Maximum energy
- Extended length
```
