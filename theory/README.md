# Music Theory for Synthesis

**Learn music theory through the lens of synthesis, sequencing, and programming**

---

## Start Here

You bought a synthesizer or MIDI controller. You can trigger presets, hit the arp button, and make sounds happen. But now you're wondering: **"How do I actually make music with this thing?"**

This curriculum teaches you music theory in a way that makes sense for how you actually work - programming sequences, adjusting parameters, and building sounds. No piano lessons required.

---

## Who This Is For

**You might be here because:**
- You program music but don't "play" instruments
- You own a MicroFreak, MIDI controller, or modular system
- You can make sounds but don't understand why some notes work together and others don't
- You've heard terms like "fifth" or "scale" but don't know what they mean practically
- You want your sequences to sound intentional instead of random

**What you'll learn:**
- Why certain notes sound good together (and which ones to use)
- How to program melodies and chord progressions that actually work
- What all those music theory terms mean in synthesis context
- How to make informed musical decisions instead of guessing

**What you won't need:**
- Ability to read sheet music (we'll show it when helpful, but it's optional)
- Piano playing skills (we focus on programming, not performance)
- Math expertise (we explain ratios and frequencies in plain language)
- Prior music training (we start from absolute zero)

## How This Curriculum Works

### The Integrated Approach

Every concept is taught through **multiple perspectives simultaneously:**

**Traditional Music Perspective:**
- Note names, intervals, scales, chords
- Keyboard diagrams and spatial relationships
- Musical terminology and standard notation

**Synthesis/Programming Perspective:**
- Frequencies, ratios, and voltage relationships
- Sequencer grids and pattern programming
- Mathematical formulas and technical implementation

**Why both?** Because the same musical idea appears in different contexts:
- Setting up a quantizer requires understanding scales
- Programming dual oscillators requires understanding intervals
- Creating chord progressions requires understanding harmony
- Filter sweeps sound better when you understand harmonic content

You'll learn to think about music in whichever way makes sense for what you're doing.

## Getting Started Paths

### "I Own a Synthesizer and Want to Understand Music"

**Start with Foundation Layer in order:**
1. What is a Note? (understand what you're controlling)
2. Intervals (understand relationships between notes)
3. Basic Scales (understand which notes work together)
4. Simple Rhythm (understand timing and gates)

**Then move to Application Layer** when you're comfortable with foundations.

---

### "I Can Sequence But My Music Sounds Random"

**You probably understand notes/rhythm but need:**
1. Basic Scales (which notes to actually use)
2. Chords (how to stack notes intentionally)
3. Progressions (how to move between chords)
4. Melody Construction (how melody relates to chords)

**Start at Application Layer**, reference Foundation topics as needed.

---

### "I Want Better Sound Design Through Theory"

**Focus on synthesis-theory connections:**
1. What is a Note? (frequency and harmonic series)
2. Intervals (ratios and beating)
3. Synthesis + Theory Connection (harmonic content and filtering)

**Use Integration Layer materials** with selective Foundation references.

---

### "I Just Need to Look Something Up"

**Go straight to Reference Layer:**
- Need a frequency? Check voltage/frequency tables
- Need a scale formula? Check scale library
- Need chord construction? Check chord reference
- Need definition? Check glossary

## Using This With Your Gear

### Modular Synthesizers

Theory concepts connect directly to:
- **Quantizers** - use scale knowledge to set modes
- **Oscillators** - understand pitch relationships and tracking
- **Sequencers** - program intentional melodic and harmonic patterns
- **Filters** - understand harmonic content for musical filtering

**Integration:** Module guides include theory explanations inline with cross-references to detailed curriculum content.

---

### MIDI Controllers and VSTs

Theory concepts apply to:
- **Piano rolls** - understand what notes you're drawing
- **Arpeggiators** - understand the intervals being generated
- **Scale modes** - choose appropriate scales for your music
- **Chord triggers** - understand what chords you're playing

**Application:** Same concepts, different interface. Theory transcends hardware.

---

### Hardware Synthesizers and Grooveboxes

Theory helps you:
- **Program sequences** with intentional note selection
- **Create patches** that complement your musical ideas
- **Use onboard arps** with understanding of what they're doing
- **Integrate with other gear** through shared musical language

---

## Realistic Expectations

**This curriculum will:**
- Give you foundational knowledge for intentional music-making
- Help you understand why certain notes/chords/progressions work
- Connect theory concepts to synthesis and programming
- Provide practical examples and exercises you can try

**This curriculum won't:**
- Make you a virtuoso performer (we focus on programming, not playing)
- Cover every possible music theory topic (we focus on practical synthesis applications)
- Replace hands-on experimentation (theory supports creativity, doesn't replace it)
- Require you to complete every exercise (learning happens even from reading)

**Learning music theory is a gradual process.** You don't need to master everything before making music. Learn what you need, when you need it, and come back for more when you're ready.

---

## How to Use This Curriculum

**Linear Path (Recommended for Beginners):**
Start at Foundation Layer, work through each topic in order, move to Application Layer when comfortable.

**As-Needed Reference:**
Jump to specific topics when you encounter them in your music-making or module guides.

**Integration with Module Guides:**
Module guides include theory explanations and link to relevant curriculum sections for deeper understanding.

**Iterative Learning:**
Read through quickly first, then revisit with hands-on practice, then return again as concepts connect.

---

## About Exercises and Practice

Each topic includes optional exercises. **You don't have to do them.** Many people learn effectively just by reading and thinking through concepts.

**If you do want hands-on practice:**
- Exercises are labeled "Try This (If You Want)"
- Alternative approaches provided (listening, conceptual, etc.)
- No judgment if you skip them
- Come back later when motivation strikes

**Learning happens in different ways for different people.** Use this curriculum however works best for you.

## Questions or Confused?

Theory curriculum is new and evolving. If something doesn't make sense, it's probably the explanation that needs improvement, not you.

**Feedback welcome:** As you work through content, note what's confusing or what explanations work well. Framework evolves based on real usage patterns.

---

## Next Steps

**Ready to start?** Head to [What is a Note?](01_foundation/pitch_voltage_basics.md) for the first foundation topic.

**Want to see how theory integrates with gear?** Check any module guide - theory explanations are included inline with links back to detailed curriculum content.

**Just browsing?** Explore the curriculum structure above and jump in wherever makes sense for your current needs.
