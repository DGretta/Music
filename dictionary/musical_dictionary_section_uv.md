**VOLTAGE**
Electrical potential difference measured in volts (V), the fundamental signal type underlying all electronic synthesis and control.

**The Fundamental Truth:**
Everything in synthesis is voltage - just different forms, speeds, and purposes:

**Signal Types (All Voltage):**
- **Audio:** Fast-changing voltage (20Hz-20kHz) we perceive as sound
- **Control Voltage (CV):** Slower voltage controlling parameters (pitch, filter, etc.)
- **Gates/Triggers:** On/off voltages marking timing events
- **LFO:** Very slow voltage for modulation (0.01Hz-20Hz)
- **Envelope:** Shaped voltage following note timing

**Voltage Ranges:**
- **Audio:** Typically Â±5V to Â±10V (bipolar, AC-coupled)
- **CV:** 0-10V (unipolar) or Â±5V (bipolar), DC-coupled
- **1V/octave:** Each volt = one octave musical interval
- **Gates:** Usually +5V (high) or 0V (low)

**Why This Matters:**
- **Universal language:** Understanding voltage unifies all synthesis concepts
- **Flexibility:** Any voltage can control any parameter (modular philosophy)
- **Interconnection:** Voltage compatibility enables devices to work together
- **Musical translation:** Voltage represents all musical parameters electrically

**Speed Determines Function:**
- **Very slow (0.01-20Hz):** LFO, modulation, automation
- **Slow (envelope):** Note-based control, dynamics
- **Audio rate (20Hz-20kHz):** Sound, FM synthesis, audio-rate modulation
- **Very fast (beyond hearing):** Clock signals, digital control

*This is the foundation:* When you understand that synthesis is fundamentally about voltages - how they're generated, shaped, and combined - everything else makes sense. Different modules are just different ways of creating, modifying, or responding to voltage.

*Related:* CV, Audio Signal, Gate, Control Voltage, Signal Types, 1V/Octave

**V-TRIG (VOLTAGE TRIGGER)**

- *Related:* S-Trig, Gate, Trigger Standards, CV/Gate
- *Polarity:* Positive-going trigger (0V â +5V = on)
- *Contrast:* S-Trig (switch trigger) uses opposite polarity or grounding

- *Compatibility:* Inverters can convert between V-trig and S-trig if needed
- *Historical:* Replaced S-trig as dominant standard in 1970s-80s
