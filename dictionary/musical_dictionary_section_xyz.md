# Musical Dictionary - Sections X/Y/Z
*Essential "X," "Y," and "Z" Terms for Synthesis, Modular, and Production*

## X

**XLR**
Three-pin balanced audio connector standard in professional audio, providing secure connection and excellent noise rejection for microphones and line-level signals.
- *Related:* Balanced Audio (Section B), Connector, Professional Audio, Microphone
- *Configuration:* Pin 1 = ground, Pin 2 = positive/hot, Pin 3 = negative/cold
- *Advantages:* Locking mechanism, balanced connection, robust, reliable
- *Applications:* Microphones, professional line-level connections, stage/studio use
- *Cable length:* Can run very long distances (100+ feet) without noise issues
- *Standard:* Universal professional audio connector, widely compatible

**XOR (EXCLUSIVE OR)**
Digital logic function that outputs HIGH only when inputs are in different states (one high, one low), useful for creating complex rhythmic patterns.
- *Truth table:* A=0,B=0→0; A=0,B=1→1; A=1,B=0→1; A=1,B=1→0
- *Related:* OR Function (Section P), Logic Gates, Boolean Logic, Trigger Processing
- *Key difference:* Unlike OR, XOR outputs LOW when both inputs are HIGH
- *Musical applications:* Creating syncopated rhythms, excluding coincident triggers
- *Pattern generation:* Combining sequences with XOR creates rhythmic variations
- *Practical example:* Two clocks through XOR create rhythm only when one fires (not both)

## Y

**Y-CABLE**
Cable with one connector splitting into two (or vice versa), used for signal splitting or combining in audio and modular systems.
- *Related:* Splitter, Multiple, Signal Distribution, Passive Splitting
- *Configurations:* 1-to-2 (splitting), 2-to-1 (combining/mixing)
- *Applications:* Splitting signals, simple mixing, adapting connections
- *Passive operation:* No active circuitry, simple wire connections
- *Caution:* Splitting can cause voltage sag, combining can cause phase issues
- *Professional alternative:* Dedicated splitters or mixers for critical applications

## Z

**ZERO CROSSING**
Point where audio waveform crosses zero amplitude line (transitions between positive and negative), important for clean audio editing and some synthesis techniques.
- *Related:* Waveform, Phase, Audio Editing, Click-free Processing
- *Importance:* Editing at zero crossings prevents clicks and pops
- *DAW function:* Most audio editors have "snap to zero crossing" feature
- *Synthesis applications:* Some oscillator sync techniques use zero crossing detection
- *Loop points:* Setting loop points at zero crossings creates seamless loops
- *Technical:* Transition point between positive and negative waveform values

**ZIPPER NOISE**
Audible stepping artifacts heard when digital parameters change too quickly or with insufficient resolution, creating characteristic "zipping" sound.
- *Related:* Digital Audio, Resolution, Artifacts, Parameter Control
- *Cause:* Discrete digital steps become audible when parameter changes rapidly
- *Common scenarios:* Filter sweeps, volume fades, modulation with low resolution
- *Prevention:* Higher control resolution (14-bit vs 7-bit), smoothing algorithms
- *Audio rate:* Moving parameters at audio rate can create intentional effects
- *Quality indicator:* Modern synthesizers minimize zipper noise through design
