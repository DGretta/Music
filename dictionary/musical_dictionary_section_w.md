## W

**WAVE**
Oscillating disturbance that transfers energy through space or medium, fundamental physical phenomenon underlying all sound and audio synthesis.
- *Related:* Waveform, Frequency, Amplitude, Sound, Oscillation
- *Sound waves:* Mechanical vibrations propagating through air or other medium
- *Electronic waves:* Electrical oscillations representing audio signals
- *Properties:* Wavelength, frequency, amplitude, phase
- *Synthesis context:* Electronic generation and manipulation of wave-like signals
- *Musical importance:* Understanding waves fundamental to all audio and synthesis

**WAVE FOLDER/WAVE FOLDING**
Nonlinear waveshaping technique that "folds" signal peaks back on themselves when amplitude exceeds threshold, creating complex harmonic content.
- *Related:* Waveshaping, Harmonic Generation, Distortion, West Coast Synthesis
- *Function:* Signal peaks exceeding threshold are reflected/folded back
- *Harmonic generation:* Creates rich, metallic, bell-like timbres with complex harmonics
- *Control:* Amount/depth parameter determines how much signal is folded
- *Character:* More aggressive and metallic than filtering, adds rather than removes content
- *Buchla tradition:* Central to West Coast synthesis approach
- *Modern examples:* Buchla 259, Make Noise DPO, various Eurorack wavefolders

**WAVEFORM**
Shape of electrical signal when displayed over time, determining harmonic content and timbral character of sound.

**Common Synthesis Waveforms:**

**Sine Wave (Section S):**
- **Harmonic content:** Fundamental only, no harmonics
- **Character:** Pure, smooth, flute-like
- **Applications:** Sub-bass, FM synthesis, pure tones

**Sawtooth (Section S):**
- **Harmonic content:** All harmonics (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th...)
- **Character:** Bright, rich, full-bodied
- **Applications:** Strings, brass, rich leads

**Square Wave (Section S):**
- **Harmonic content:** Odd harmonics only (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th...)
- **Character:** Hollow, reedy, clarinet-like
- **Applications:** Hollow leads, bass, PWM starting point

**Triangle Wave (Section T):**
- **Harmonic content:** Odd harmonics, rapid amplitude decrease
- **Character:** Smooth, mellow, gentle
- **Applications:** Flute-like sounds, smooth bass, mellow leads

*Related:* Oscillator, Harmonics, Timbre, Spectrum, Sound Design
*Visualization:* Oscilloscope displays waveform shape directly

**WAVE SHAPER/WAVESHAPING**
Process of altering waveform shape through nonlinear transfer functions, creating new harmonic content and timbral variations.
- *Related:* Wave Folding, Distortion, Harmonic Generation, Transfer Function
- *Method:* Input signal mapped through nonlinear function to create output
- *Types:* Soft clipping, hard clipping, wave folding, arbitrary transfer functions
- *Applications:* Adding harmonics, creating timbral complexity, distortion effects
- *West Coast philosophy:* Generate complexity at source rather than filter after
- *Control:* Shape/amount parameters determine intensity of effect
- *Mathematical:* Can be described by mathematical transfer functions

**WAVETABLE**
Synthesis method using stored waveform data that can be scanned through or morphed between for dynamic timbral changes.
- *Related:* Digital Synthesis, Waveform, Morphing, Scanning, PPG
- *Concept:* Multiple single-cycle waveforms stored in table, position scanned through
- *Control:* Position/index parameter determines which waveform plays
- *Scanning:* Smooth movement through table creates evolving timbres
- *Modulation:* LFOs/envelopes can modulate table position for animation
- *Historical:* PPG Wave series popularized wavetable synthesis in 1980s
- *Modern:* Standard feature in many digital and software synthesizers

**WEST COAST SYNTHESIS (VS EAST COAST)**
Synthesis philosophy developed by Don Buchla emphasizing complex oscillators, wavefolding, low-pass gates, and non-keyboard controllers. Alternative approach to traditional subtractive synthesis.

**West Coast (Buchla) Philosophy:**
- **Sound generation:** Complex oscillators generate harmonics at source
- **Processing:** Wave folding, wavefolding, phase modulation
- **Amplitude control:** Low-pass gates combine filtering and amplitude naturally
- **Controllers:** Touch plates, ribbons, joysticks instead of keyboards
- **Philosophy:** Exploration, unpredictability, organic sounds
- **Character:** Evolving, percussive, organic timbres

**East Coast (Moog) Philosophy:**
- **Sound generation:** Simple waveforms (saw, square, triangle)
- **Processing:** Subtractive filtering removes harmonics
- **Amplitude control:** Separate VCA for amplitude control
- **Controllers:** Keyboard-centric, precise pitch control
- **Philosophy:** Predictable, musical, traditional approach
- **Character:** Focused, punchy, musical sounds

**Key Differences:**
- **Harmonic generation:** Add complexity (West) vs. remove complexity (East)
- **Signal flow:** Non-linear (West) vs. linear (East)
- **Control approach:** Experimental (West) vs. traditional (East)
- **Musical results:** Organic/percussive (West) vs. melodic/harmonic (East)

**Modern Context:**
- **Hybrid approaches:** Many contemporary systems blend both philosophies
- **Eurorack influence:** West Coast concepts widely adopted in modular synthesis
- **Complementary:** Neither superior, both valuable for different musical goals

*Related:* Buchla, Moog, Subtractive Synthesis, Complex Oscillator, LPG, Wave Folding

**WET**
Processed signal in effects processing, containing the effect output. Complement to dry (unprocessed) signal.
- *Related:* Dry, Wet/Dry Mix, Effects, Signal Processing
- *100% wet:* Only processed signal, no original
- *Typical use:* Blend wet and dry signals for desired effect amount
- *Send/return:* Wet signal returned from effect processor
- *Parallel processing:* Wet and dry signals processed independently then mixed
- *Creative extreme:* 100% wet can create interesting abstract effects

**WET SOUND**
Acoustic or electronic sound with audible reverberation, delay, or spatial effects, creating sense of space and depth.
- *Related:* Reverb, Delay, Wet/Dry, Spatial Effects, Ambience
- *Contrast:* Dry sound lacks spatial effects, sounds close and intimate
- *Musical applications:* Creating depth, space, distance in mixes
- *Amount control:* How much reverb/delay determines "wetness"
- *Genre differences:* Electronic music often uses more wet sounds than acoustic recordings
- *Mix balance:* Too much wetness can muddy mix, too little sounds flat

**WHITE NOISE**
Random signal with equal energy at all frequencies across audible spectrum, sounding like radio static or rushing air.
- *Related:* Pink Noise (Section P), Noise Colors (Section N), Random, Spectrum
- *Characteristics:* Flat frequency response, equal energy per Hz
- *Sound:* Bright, hissy, like TV static or rushing air
- *Applications:* Percussion synthesis (snares, hi-hats), wind effects, masking noise
- *Filtering:* Filtering white noise creates wide range of timbres and textures
- *Technical use:* Audio system testing, acoustic measurement
- *Synthesis source:* Starting point for percussion and effect synthesis

**WOGGLEBUG**
Make Noise module exemplifying "source of uncertainty" philosophy, generating musical random voltages and rhythmic variations for generative patches.
- *Related:* Source of Uncertainty (Section S), Random, Buchla Philosophy, Chaos
- *Outputs:* Smooth random, stepped random, burst/trigger outputs
- *Character:* Musical randomness rather than purely mathematical
- *Self-modulation:* Can modulate its own parameters for evolving behavior
- *Philosophy:* Embracing unpredictability and chaos for organic, living patches
- *Applications:* Generative music, organic modulation, evolving sequences
- *Buchla inspiration:* Modern interpretation of Buchla 265/266 Source of Uncertainty
