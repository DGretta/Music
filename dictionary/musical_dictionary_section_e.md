## E

**EAST COAST/WEST COAST SYNTHESIS**
Two fundamental philosophies of analog synthesis representing different approaches to sound creation and musical expression.

**East Coast (Moog Style):**
- **Philosophy:** Subtractive synthesis - start complex, filter down to desired sound
- **Signal flow:** Oscillator → Filter → Amplifier (linear, predictable path)
- **Control:** Keyboard-centric, precise pitch control, traditional musical interfaces
- **Character:** Focused, punchy, musical sounds; excellent for bass and leads
- **Filter emphasis:** Heavy reliance on voltage-controlled filters for sound shaping
- **Examples:** Moog synthesizers, most traditional analog synthesizers

**West Coast (Buchla Style):**
- **Philosophy:** Complex oscillator approach - generate complexity at the source
- **Signal flow:** Non-linear, patch-dependent, exploratory signal routing
- **Control:** Touch plates, ribbon controllers, joysticks; less keyboard-focused  
- **Character:** Organic, evolving, unpredictable sounds; excellent for textures and percussion
- **LPG emphasis:** Low-pass gates combine filtering and amplitude control
- **Examples:** Buchla synthesizers, Make Noise, many Eurorack modules

*Related:* Buchla, Moog, Subtractive Synthesis, Complex Oscillator, LPG
*Modern context:* Many contemporary systems blend both approaches
