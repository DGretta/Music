- *Usage context:* Often preferred for CV processing rather than audio amplitude control

**LINEAR VCO**
Voltage Controlled Oscillator where frequency changes linearly with control voltage rather than exponentially (1V/octave).
- *Related:* Exponential VCO, 1V/Octave, Hz/V, Frequency Control
- *Response:* Equal voltage changes produce equal frequency changes (Hz)

- *Musical limitation:* Doesn't track musical intervals naturally like exponential VCOs

**LINE LEVEL**
Standard signal level for professional audio equipment, typically +4dBu (professional) or -10dBV (consumer). Reference level for proper gain staging.
- *Professional:* +4dBu (1.23V RMS) used in studios and professional gear
- *Consumer:* -10dBV (0.316V RMS) used in home audio equipment
- *Related:* Signal Level, Gain Staging, Impedance, Headroom

**LOGIC (DIGITAL LOGIC FUNCTIONS)**
Boolean operations that process digital signals (high/low, on/off states) to create complex trigger and gate patterns. Essential for rhythmic and generative applications.

**Basic Logic Functions:**
- **AND:** Output high only when ALL inputs are high
- **OR:** Output high when ANY input is high  
- **NOT (Inverter):** Output opposite of input state
- **NAND:** AND followed by NOT (output low only when all inputs high)
- **NOR:** OR followed by NOT (output high only when all inputs low)
- **XOR (Exclusive OR):** Output high when inputs are different states

- *Modern context:* Most contemporary gear uses high gate standard

**LOW PASS GATE (LPG)**
Unique circuit combining low-pass filtering and voltage-controlled amplification in a single module, creating natural-sounding decay characteristics. Central to Buchla/West Coast synthesis philosophy.

**How LPG Works:**
- **Combines:** Low-pass filter + VCA in single circuit using vactrol (light-controlled resistor)
- **Natural behavior:** As signal gets quieter, it also gets darker (like acoustic instruments)
- **Vactrol character:** Slow response creates organic, musical decay characteristics

**Common Confusions:**
- **Not just a filter:** Controls both amplitude AND frequency content simultaneously  
- **Not just a VCA:** Provides filtering that regular VCAs cannot
- **Not additive:** Cannot separate filter and VCA functions - they're inherently linked

**How to Use LPG:**
- **Strike input:** Trigger input creates natural percussive decays
- **Audio input:** Process any audio source through LPG for organic character
- **CV control:** Control voltage adjusts both brightness and amplitude together
- **No resonance:** Traditional LPGs don't have resonance controls like regular filters

**Musical Applications:**
- **Percussive sounds:** Natural drum and percussion timbres
- **Plucked instruments:** Guitar, harp, and string-like sounds  
- **Organic processing:** Make any sound source feel more natural and acoustic-like
- **West Coast patches:** Essential element of Buchla-style synthesis approach

*Related:* Buchla, West Coast Synthesis, Vactrol, Low-Pass Filter, VCA
*Key insight:* LPG creates the natural relationship between loudness and brightness found in acoustic instruments

**LPF (LOW-PASS FILTER)**
Filter that allows low frequencies to pass while attenuating high frequencies above the cutoff point. Most common filter type in subtractive synthesis.
- *Related:* High-Pass Filter, Cutoff Frequency, Resonance, Subtractive Synthesis
- *Function:* Removes brightness, creates warmer/darker sounds
- *Parameters:* Cutoff frequency, resonance (Q), sometimes drive or saturation
- *Synthesis role:* Primary tool for shaping harmonic content, creating movement over time
- *Modulation targets:* Cutoff frequency commonly controlled by envelopes, LFOs, keyboard tracking
- *Self-oscillation:* High resonance settings can cause filter to generate pure tones
