## O

**OCTAVE**
Musical interval representing a doubling of frequency, creating the most consonant harmonic relationship after unison. Foundation of musical tuning systems and synthesis control standards.

- *Related:* Frequency, Pitch, Harmonic Series, Musical Intervals
- *Perceptual equivalence:* Notes separated by octaves sound like the same pitch class
- *Synthesis significance:* 1V/octave control standard based on this logarithmic relationship

**1V/OCTAVE (AND OTHER OCTAVE STANDARDS)**
Control voltage standard where each 1-volt increase doubles the oscillator frequency (raises pitch by one octave). Dominant tuning standard in modern synthesis.

**1V/Octave Standard:**

- *Loading effects:* Too many connections can cause signal level drop and frequency response changes

**OVERDRIVE**
Type of soft distortion that gradually compresses and adds harmonics to signals as they exceed the "clean" range, creating warm saturation rather than hard clipping.
