## C

**CARRIER**
In frequency modulation (FM) synthesis, the oscillator that produces the audible output tone. The carrier frequency is modulated by the modulator oscillator to create complex harmonic content.
- *Related:* FM Synthesis, Modulator, Operator, Harmonic Content
- *Relationship:* Carrier determines the fundamental pitch, modulator creates the harmonics
- *FM ratio:* Carrier to modulator frequency ratio determines harmonic relationships
