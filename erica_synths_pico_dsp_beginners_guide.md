## Beginner Patch Ideas

### **Patch 1: Ambient Pad Creation**
- **Simple oscillator** ‚Üí Pico DSP IN
- **Effect:** Granular Delay (Blue)

- **Result:** Frozen, evolving ambient textures from simple sources

### **Patch 2: Rhythmic Stereo Delays**
- **Drum pattern** ‚Üí Pico DSP IN
- **Effect:** Stereo Delay (Green)
- **PAR1 synced to tempo** (1/8 or 1/16 note timing)
- **PAR2 around 12 o'clock** (moderate feedback)
- **LFO** ‚Üí CV input (for delay time modulation)
- **Result:** Dynamic ping-pong delays that move with your rhythm

### **Patch 3: Vintage Organ Simulation**
- **Chord-playing oscillator** ‚Üí Pico DSP IN
- **Effect:** Leslie Speaker (Cyan)
- **PAR1 around 1 o'clock** (medium rotation)
- **PAR2 at 10 o'clock** (slight high-pass)
- **DRY/WET at 2 o'clock** (effect-heavy)

## Advanced Techniques

### **CV Modulation Strategies:**
- **LFO ‚Üí CV Input:** Animated parameter sweeps

- **Captures current audio** and loops it indefinitely
- **PAR2 controls loop length** when frozen
- **Performance technique:** Freeze interesting moments, then manipulate

### **Signal Chain Strategies:**
- **Early in chain:** Process oscillators before filters
- **Late in chain:** Process final mix for polish
- **Parallel processing:** Mix dry signal separately for blend control
- **Feedback loops:** Route outputs back through other modules

## Beginner "Gotchas" & Pro Tips

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:**

**"I don't hear any stereo effect!"**
- Must use both L and R outputs to hear stereo processing
- **Solution:** Connect both outputs to a stereo mixer or interface

**"My signal is distorting!"**
- Input signal too hot, clipping LED is lighting up
- **Solution:** Reduce input level or use attenuator before Pico DSP

**"The effect doesn't sound right!"**
- Some effects need specific DRY/WET settings to sound their best
- **Solution:** Experiment with DRY/WET balance, many effects sound best with more wet signal

### **üéµ Pro Tips:**

**Effect Selection Strategy:**
- **Learn the LED colors** - much faster than button counting
- **Start with Stereo Delay and Reverb** - most immediately useful
- **Granular Delay freeze mode** - perfect for live looping and texture creation

**Parameter Sweet Spots:**
- **Delay times:** Set by ear or use clock dividers for musical timing
- **Feedback settings:** 50-75% for musical repeats, higher for chaos
- **DRY/WET balance:** 30-70% wet for most applications, 100% wet for creative processing

**CV Modulation Tips:**
- **Slow LFO on delay time** - creates warping, tape-like effects
- **Fast LFO on reverb time** - creates gated reverb effects
- **Random voltage on parameters** - organic, evolving effects
- **Envelope on DRY/WET** - effect intensity follows dynamics

**Performance Techniques:**
- **Effect switching** - instant texture changes during performance
- **Freeze mode tricks** - capture and manipulate live audio
- **CV automation** - pre-programmed effect changes
- **DRY/WET sweeps** - dramatic builds and breakdowns
