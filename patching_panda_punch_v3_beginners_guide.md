**The Ultimate VCA-Decay Module for Dynamic Percussion**

---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Sound in 5 Minutes

**What is Punch V3?** A dual-channel VCA with built-in voltage-controlled decay envelopes. It's designed to turn any audio source into dynamic, percussive sounds with vintage drum machine character or modern CV expressiveness. Think of it as giving any sound source the "punch" and dynamics of classic drum machines.

### Your First Drum Hit (Vintage Mode)
1. **Patch oscillator/noise** ‚Üí **IN** (Channel 1)
2. **Set mode switch** to **Vintage** (left position)
3. **Turn DECAY** to around 1 o'clock
4. **Turn AMOUNT** to 2 o'clock
5. **Patch trigger/gate** ‚Üí **TRIG|CV** input
6. **Patch output** ‚Üí your mixer
7. **Trigger it!** - instant punchy drum sound with exponential decay

### Your First Dynamic Voice (CV Mode)
1. **Switch to CV mode** (right position)
2. **Patch velocity/CV** ‚Üí **ACC|VEL** input
3. **Use same audio source** and trigger
4. **Notice** how the dynamics change with velocity!
5. **Turn CURVE** knob - changes from smooth to aggressive response

## Understanding the Two Modes

### **Vintage Drum Machine Mode:**

- **Accent function:** ACC input adds extra "punch" when triggered
- **Use cases:** Traditional drum programming, consistent percussion
- **Character:** Reliable, punchy, vintage-style dynamics

### **Dynamic CV Mode:**
- **Behavior:** Velocity/CV sensitive like modern instruments
- **Trigger response:** Intensity varies with input CV voltage
- **Velocity function:** ACC|VEL input scales the entire envelope
- **Use cases:** Expressive playing, dynamic sequences, modern production
- **Character:** Responsive, musical, contemporary feel

## Beginner Patch Ideas

### **Patch 1: Classic Kick Drum**

- **Mode:** Vintage
- **DECAY at 11 o'clock** (short, punchy)
- **CURVE at 3 o'clock** (aggressive)
- **AMOUNT at 2 o'clock** (good level)
- **Kick pattern** ‚Üí **TRIG|CV**
- **Result:** Classic analog kick drum with punch

### **Patch 2: Expressive Hi-Hat**
- **Noise source** ‚Üí **IN**

- **Result:** Dynamic hi-hats that respond to velocity

### **Patch 3: Sidechain Compression Effect**
- **Bass/pad sound** ‚Üí **IN**
- **Constant gate/trigger** ‚Üí **TRIG|CV** (always on)
- **Kick trigger** ‚Üí **ACC|VEL**
- **INVERT switch ON** (negative envelope)
- **DECAY around 12 o'clock** (pumping speed)
- **Result:** Classic sidechain pumping effect

## Beginner "Gotchas" & Pro Tips

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:**

**"My drums don't sound punchy enough!"**
- AMOUNT might be too low, or CURVE not aggressive enough
- **Solution:** Increase AMOUNT to 2-3 o'clock, try more aggressive CURVE settings

**"The velocity doesn't seem to work!"**
- Make sure you're in CV mode, not Vintage mode
- **Solution:** Check mode switch position and ensure CV/velocity is patched to ACC|VEL

**"I can't get long, sustained sounds!"**
- DECAY might be too short, or mode might affect sustain
- **Solution:** Turn DECAY clockwise, experiment with CURVE settings

### **üéµ Pro Tips:**

**Mode Selection Strategy:**

**Curve Control Usage:**
- **CCW (smooth):** More musical, less aggressive
- **12 o'clock:** Balanced, versatile response
- **CW (aggressive):** Sharp, snappy, vintage drum machine feel

**Accent/Velocity Programming:**
- **Vintage mode:** Use accent sparingly for emphasis
