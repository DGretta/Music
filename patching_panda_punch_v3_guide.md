# Patching Panda Punch V3 - Beginner's Guide

**The Ultimate VCA-Decay Module for Dynamic Percussion**

---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Sound in 5 Minutes

**What is Punch V3?** A dual-channel VCA with built-in voltage-controlled decay envelopes. It's designed to turn any audio source into dynamic, percussive sounds with vintage drum machine character or modern CV expressiveness. Think of it as giving any sound source the "punch" and dynamics of classic drum machines.

### Your First Drum Hit (Vintage Mode)
1. **Patch oscillator/noise** → **IN** (Channel 1)
2. **Set mode switch** to **Vintage** (left position)
3. **Turn DECAY** to around 1 o'clock
4. **Turn AMOUNT** to 2 o'clock
5. **Patch trigger/gate** → **TRIG|CV** input
6. **Patch output** → your mixer
7. **Trigger it!** - instant punchy drum sound with exponential decay

### Your First Dynamic Voice (CV Mode)
1. **Switch to CV mode** (right position)
2. **Patch velocity/CV** → **ACC|VEL** input
3. **Use same audio source** and trigger
4. **Notice** how the dynamics change with velocity!
5. **Turn CURVE** knob - changes from smooth to aggressive response

## Essential Parameters (The Big 6)

### **1. Mode Switch (Vintage vs. CV)**
- **Vintage Mode:** Classic drum machine behavior with fixed response
- **CV Mode:** Dynamic CV control with velocity sensitivity
- **Key difference:** Vintage = consistent hits, CV = expressive dynamics
- **Pro tip:** Switch between modes during performance for different feels

### **2. DECAY Control + CV Input**
- **What it does:** Controls how long the envelope takes to fade out
- **Musical result:** Short = snappy hits, Long = sustained sounds
- **CV input:** External control over decay time
- **Range:** From percussive snaps to long, evolving textures

### **3. AMOUNT (Gain) Control**
- **What it does:** Sets the level/intensity of the VCA response
- **Musical result:** Controls the "punch" and dynamics
- **CV capability:** Can be modulated for AM (amplitude modulation) effects
- **Sweet spot:** 12-3 o'clock for most applications

### **4. CURVE Control**
- **What it does:** Changes the exponential response of the decay envelope
- **Range:** Smooth (linear) to aggressive (sharp exponential)
- **Musical impact:** Affects the "snap" and character of the decay
- **Performance use:** Real-time timbre shaping

### **5. ACC|VEL (Accent/Velocity) Input**
- **Vintage Mode:** Accent input for drum machine-style dynamics
- **CV Mode:** Velocity input for expressive control
- **Musical result:** Adds dynamics and expression to your sounds
- **Creative use:** Any CV source can control intensity

### **6. ENV Output + Invert Switch**
- **ENV Output:** Sends the envelope CV to other modules
- **Invert Switch:** Flips the envelope from positive to negative
- **Creative applications:** Inverted envelopes for ducking/sidechain effects
- **Modulation source:** Use envelope to control other parameters

---

## Understanding the Two Modes

### **Vintage Drum Machine Mode:**
- **Behavior:** Fixed, consistent response like classic drum machines
- **Trigger response:** Every trigger produces the same intensity
- **Accent function:** ACC input adds extra "punch" when triggered
- **Use cases:** Traditional drum programming, consistent percussion
- **Character:** Reliable, punchy, vintage-style dynamics

### **Dynamic CV Mode:**
- **Behavior:** Velocity/CV sensitive like modern instruments
- **Trigger response:** Intensity varies with input CV voltage
- **Velocity function:** ACC|VEL input scales the entire envelope
- **Use cases:** Expressive playing, dynamic sequences, modern production
- **Character:** Responsive, musical, contemporary feel

## Beginner Patch Ideas

### **Patch 1: Classic Kick Drum**
- **Sine/triangle oscillator** → **IN**
- **Mode:** Vintage
- **DECAY at 11 o'clock** (short, punchy)
- **CURVE at 3 o'clock** (aggressive)
- **AMOUNT at 2 o'clock** (good level)
- **Kick pattern** → **TRIG|CV**
- **Result:** Classic analog kick drum with punch

### **Patch 2: Expressive Hi-Hat**
- **Noise source** → **IN**
- **Mode:** CV (for velocity sensitivity)
- **DECAY at 9 o'clock** (very short)
- **Velocity sequence** → **ACC|VEL** (dynamic hi-hats)
- **Hi-hat pattern** → **TRIG|CV**
- **Result:** Dynamic hi-hats that respond to velocity

### **Patch 3: Sidechain Compression Effect**
- **Bass/pad sound** → **IN**
- **Constant gate/trigger** → **TRIG|CV** (always on)
- **Kick trigger** → **ACC|VEL**
- **INVERT switch ON** (negative envelope)
- **DECAY around 12 o'clock** (pumping speed)
- **Result:** Classic sidechain pumping effect

4. **Touch performance control:** Bloom's touch interface provides real-time human expression
5. **Multi-algorithm flexibility:** Disting can switch algorithms for different processing types per song/section

**Why This Multi-Function Ecosystem Works:**
- **Leverages actual capabilities:** Uses modules for their intended multi-function design
- **No single-function overlap:** Each module contributes unique multi-function capabilities  
- **Algorithm flexibility:** Disting can adapt to any processing needs via algorithm switching
- **Scalable complexity:** Can be simple (basic patterns) or sophisticated (generative + algorithmic processing)
- **Combinable with other guides:** No modulation source conflicts since other guides use different multi-function approaches

**Expert System Performance:**
1. **Initialization:** Bloom establishes generative patterns, Disting loads appropriate algorithm
2. **Processing chain:** Bloom CV → Disting algorithm → Function Junction math → Punch V3 percussion
3. **Touch expression:** Real-time human control via Bloom's touch interface
4. **Algorithm evolution:** Switch Disting algorithms mid-performance for different processing character
5. **Generative development:** System evolves complex percussion relationships through multi-function interaction

**Philosophical Achievement:**
This represents **multi-function percussion mastery** - where generative sequencing, algorithmic processing, and mathematical CV operations all serve the percussion engine, creating a professional workstation that leverages each module's complete capabilities rather than using them as single-function devices.

## Beginner "Gotchas" & Pro Tips

### **⚠️ Common Mistakes:**

**"My drums don't sound punchy enough!"**
- AMOUNT might be too low, or CURVE not aggressive enough
- **Solution:** Increase AMOUNT to 2-3 o'clock, try more aggressive CURVE settings

**"The velocity doesn't seem to work!"**
- Make sure you're in CV mode, not Vintage mode
- **Solution:** Check mode switch position and ensure CV/velocity is patched to ACC|VEL

**"I can't get long, sustained sounds!"**
- DECAY might be too short, or mode might affect sustain
- **Solution:** Turn DECAY clockwise, experiment with CURVE settings

### **🎵 Pro Tips:**

**Mode Selection Strategy:**
- **Vintage mode:** When you want consistent, reliable hits
- **CV mode:** When you want expressive, dynamic performance
- **Switch during performance:** Creates instant character changes

**Decay Time Sweet Spots:**
- **9-10 o'clock:** Snappy hi-hats and percussion
- **11-1 o'clock:** Punchy kicks and snares
- **2-4 o'clock:** Sustained hits and tonal sounds
- **5 o'clock:** Long, evolving textures

**Curve Control Usage:**
- **CCW (smooth):** More musical, less aggressive
- **12 o'clock:** Balanced, versatile response
- **CW (aggressive):** Sharp, snappy, vintage drum machine feel

**Accent/Velocity Programming:**
- **Vintage mode:** Use accent sparingly for emphasis
- **CV mode:** Vary velocity continuously for musical expression
- **Combine:** Use both trigger timing AND accent/velocity for complex rhythms
