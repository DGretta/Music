# Bizarre Jezabel Pkhia MK2 - Beginner's Guide

**The Analog Stereo Filter Sculptor**

---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Filtered Sound in 5 Minutes

**What is Pkhia MK2?** Think of it as two analog multi-mode filters in one module, designed specifically for stereo processing. It's a dual/stereo analog filter that can shape your sounds with surgical precision while maintaining that warm analog character. Each channel offers multiple filter modes (low-pass, band-pass, high-pass), and they can work independently as dual-mono filters or together as a true stereo processor.

### Your First Stereo Filter Sweep
1. **Connect audio source** ‚Üí **Left and Right inputs** (or just Left for mono-to-stereo)
2. **Connect Pkhia outputs** ‚Üí **Left and Right audio outputs** to your mixer
3. **Turn up both CUTOFF knobs** to around 12 o'clock
4. **Connect LFO** ‚Üí **CV input for filter cutoff**
5. **Slowly adjust CUTOFF knobs** while audio plays to hear the filter response
6. **Try different filter outputs** (LP, BP, HP) to hear the different modes

**Congratulations!** You've just experienced high-quality analog stereo filtering with independent channel control!

## Essential Parameters (The Dual Filter System)

### **1. Dual Filter Architecture**
- **Two independent analog filters:** Left and Right channels with separate controls
- **Multi-mode outputs:** Low-pass (LP), Band-pass (BP), and High-pass (HP) per channel  
- **Stereo or dual-mono:** Use as true stereo processor or two separate mono filters
- **Mono-to-stereo:** Feed mono signal to Left, get processed stereo output
- **Independent cutoff control:** Each channel can have different cutoff frequencies
- **Linked or separate CV:** Control both together or independently

### **2. Filter Cutoff Controls**

## Beginner Patch Ideas

### **Patch 1: Classic Stereo Filter Sweep**
```
[Stereo source] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Pkhia L&R inputs]
[LFO] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [1+2 CV input] (controls both filters)
[Pkhia LP L&R] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Stereo mixer/output]
```
**Setup:** Use LP outputs for classic low-pass filtering
**Controls:** LFO creates automatic stereo filter sweeps
**Result:** Classic analog filter movement on stereo material
**Performance:** Adjust cutoff knobs for different sweep ranges

### **Patch 2: Dual-Mono Processing**
```
[Mono source 1] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Pkhia Left input]
[Mono source 2] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Pkhia Right input]  
[Envelope 1] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Left CV input]
[Envelope 2] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Right CV input]
```
**Setup:** Two different sources, independent envelope control
**Result:** Two mono sources with separate filter envelopes
**Creative:** Use different filter modes (LP vs HP) for contrast
**Performance:** Independent cutoff control for each voice

### **Patch 3: Parallel Multi-Mode Processing**
```
[Mono source] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Multiple/Splitter] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Pkhia Left input]
                                        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Pkhia Right input]
[Pkhia LP Left] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Mixer channel 1]
[Pkhia HP Right] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Mixer channel 2]
```
**Setup:** Same source through different filter modes
**Result:** Parallel low-pass and high-pass processing
**Mix:** Blend LP and HP for frequency-splitting effects
**Advanced:** Try BP on one channel for three-way frequency split

### **Patch 4: Mono-to-Stereo Widening**
```
[Mono source] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Pkhia Left input only]
[LFO 1] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Left CV input] (slow)
[LFO 2] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Right CV input] (slightly faster)
[Pkhia LP L&R] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Stereo output]
```
**Setup:** Mono input, different LFO rates on each filter
**Result:** Mono source becomes wide stereo with moving filters
**Timing:** Use related but different LFO speeds (2:3 ratio)
**Width:** Different cutoff movements create stereo interest

## Beginner "Gotchas"

### **Version Confusion - MK2 vs Original**
- **Different versions exist:** Pkhia, Pkhia MK2, Pkhi, etc.
- **Feature differences:** Original has VCAs, MK2 may be filter-only
- **Check your version:** Features described may vary by model
- **ModularGrid listings:** Multiple entries for different versions
- **Manual important:** Refer to documentation for your specific version

### **Multiple Output Confusion**
- **Six outputs total:** LP, BP, HP for both left and right channels
- **Not all need to be used:** Start with just LP outputs
- **Different sonic characters:** Each filter mode sounds completely different
- **Patch organization:** Label your cables - easy to get confused
- **Start simple:** Use one filter mode at a time initially

### **CV Input Behavior**
- **1+2 input controls both:** When patched, affects left AND right filters
- **Individual inputs:** Left and right CV inputs work independently
- **Normalling behavior:** Check if individual inputs override 1+2 input
- **CV amount:** May need attenuation for subtle effects
- **Polarity:** Some CV sources may need inversion for desired effect

### **Stereo vs Dual-Mono Mindset**
- **Two different uses:** Stereo processing vs two separate mono processors
- **Input requirements:** Stereo needs L&R inputs, dual-mono can use either
- **Output expectations:** Don't expect automatic stereo from mono input
- **Routing flexibility:** Can be used in ways not immediately obvious
- **Experimentation required:** Try different input/output combinations

### **Boutique Module Characteristics**
- **Small company:** Bizarre Jezabel is a boutique European manufacturer
- **Limited documentation:** May have less online information than major brands
- **Build quality:** Hand-built modules with attention to analog detail
- **Availability:** May be harder to find than mainstream modules
- **Support:** Contact manufacturer directly for technical questions

2. **Explore CV modulation** - try different LFO speeds and envelope shapes
3. **Experiment with routing** - stereo vs dual-mono vs mono-to-stereo
4. **Practice frequency splitting** - use different modes for multi-band effects
5. **Try parallel processing** - same source through multiple filter modes
6. **Study analog filter theory** - understand cutoff, resonance, and filter types

**Remember:** Pkhia MK2 rewards experimentation with routing - try unconventional input/output combinations!
