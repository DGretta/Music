## POWER CONSUMPTION ANALYSIS

### NiftyCase Power Supply: 1500mA @ +12V, 500mA @ -12V

| Module | +12V | -12V | Notes |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Euclidian Circles V2** | 0mA | 0mA | 5V only: 70-160mA (LED brightness dependent) |
| **QD Quad Drum** | 120mA | 10mA | Digital drum synthesis engine |
| **QEX Quad Drum Expander** | 25mA | 10mA | Expander for QD |
| **Asteroid BD** | 13mA | 11mA | Analog kick synthesizer |
| **Rotating Clock Divider V2** | 33mA | 4mA | Clock division processing |
| **Numeric Repetitor** | 50mA | 5mA | Advanced clock manipulation |
| **Punch V3** | 55mA | 52mA | Analog compressor/dynamics |
| **Squawk Dirty to Me** | 40mA | 40mA | Analog filter circuit |
| **Pico Drums2** | 30mA | 5mA | Digital drum voices |
| **CMOS Party** | 23mA | 5mA | Logic operations |
| **Mixup** | 15mA | 16mA | Performance mixer |
| **2hp Mult** | 0mA | 0mA | Passive circuit |
| **TOTAL** | **404mA** | **158mA** | **Very safe margins** |

**Power Headroom:** +12V: 1096mA remaining (73%), -12V: 342mA remaining (68%)
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Massive headroom for stable operation and future expansion

### **Master Clock Configuration - Euclidian Circles V2:**
- **Internal clock range:** 10-2500 BPM
- **No numeric BPM display** - tempo setting is by feel/ear using middle encoder
- **Setting tempo:** Long press middle encoder to enter AUTO CLOCK mode, rotate clockwise to increase speed
- **Tap tempo function:** Most precise method for setting specific BPMs (use F-BUTTON)
- **Visual feedback:** LED rings show pattern activity but not numeric BPM
- **Recommendation:** Use tap tempo for precise BPM matching with DAW or other equipment

## CABLE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

### Cable Requirements by Type:
- **Long cables (12"+):** 12-15 pieces (cross-case clock and trigger routing)
- **Medium cables (6-8"):** 15-20 pieces (drum voice routing, processing chains)
- **Short cables (3-4"):** 10-12 pieces (adjacent module connections)
- **Stackable cables:** 8-10 pieces (multiple trigger distribution)

### Cable Organization by Function:

**RED cables - Clock/Trigger signals:**
- EC V2 master clock → RCD, Numeric Repetitor inputs

### Physical Cable Routing:
```
TOP RAIL: Clock distribution and trigger signals
MID SPACE: Audio routing and processing chains  
BOTTOM: Power, CV modulation, and utility connections
```

### Percussion-Specific Routing:
