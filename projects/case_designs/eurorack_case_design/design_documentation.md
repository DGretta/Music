## Interior Framework Geometry - CALCULATED

### **Design Philosophy**
**Interior Framework:** Hard angles for precise rail mounting and structural accuracy
**Exterior Cherry Shell:** Smooth flowing curves shaped by eye for sculptural beauty
**Responsibility Division:** Engineering provides skeleton dimensions, craftsmanship provides soul

### **Depth Strategy by Section**
- **Bottom Section (Horizontal 0°):** 4.5" (114mm) constant depth
- **Top Section (Vertical 90°):** 3" (76mm) constant depth  
- **Angular Transition:** Progressive depth change from 4.5" to 3" over transition zone
- **Ratio:** 3:2 depth relationship (darkroom chemistry influence)

### **Interior Framework Calculations**

**Horizontal Section (Bottom - 0° Rails):**
- **Total height:** 3U + 1U + 3U = 168.15mm (6.62")
- **Depth:** 4.5" (114mm) constant
- **Rail positions:** Standard 3U spacing throughout

**Angular Transition Framework:**

**30° Section (3U):**

- **Depth:** 3" (76mm) constant
- **Vertical mounting:** Standard rail spacing

### **Critical Framework Dimensions**

**Total Horizontal Projection:** ~203.6mm (8.02") forward from vertical back edge
**Total Vertical Height:** ~670.4mm (26.4") from base to top
**Depth Transition Zone:** 4.5" to 3" over ~8" horizontal distance

### **Minimum Envelope Constraints for Cherry Shell**

## Project Return Guide - "What Do I Need to Know?"

### **Current Status Summary**
**Where we left off:** All major design decisions locked in, ready for vendor responses and template development phase.

**Immediate next steps when resuming:**
1. **Check vendor responses** - Trogotronic vs. Konstant Lab power supply decision
2. **Begin cardboard mockups** - full-scale spatial testing before cherry commitment
3. **Calculate final rail/hardware orders** - 36 rails, 36 end caps, M4 mounting bolts

### **Critical Design Decisions Made**

**Why These Choices Matter:**
- **3:2 depth ratio (4.5"/3")** - Based on darkroom chemistry experience, not arbitrary
- **Custom titanium draw latches** - Road case reliability, gold anodized handles, steel springs
- **Quarter power distribution (5A each)** - Fault isolation, thermal spread, Moog module accommodation
- **Material authenticity** - No artificial enhancement, "wood doesn't chameleon like people do"
- **Internal angles, external curves** - Engineering skeleton with sculptural beauty

### **Key Technical Constraints to Remember**

**Interior Framework Requirements:**
- **Total envelope:** 670mm height, 204mm forward projection, 4.5"-3" depth transition
- **Power clearances:** Independent supplies per case, bus board access from removable backs
- **Thermal management:** 120mm fans, 3D printed isolation, RPi monitoring
- **Module capacity:** 1,512HP total (1,176 in 3U, 336 in 1U)

### **Vendor Decision Criteria**
**Trogotronic vs. Konstant Lab evaluation based on:**
- Documentation quality and technical accuracy
- Community reputation and support responsiveness  
- Long-term parts availability
- Response quality to your technical questions

### **Design Philosophy Reminders**

**Core Principles to Maintain:**
- **Single standard** - No compromises on precision regardless of visibility
- **Power the design, don't design to power** - Function drives form
- **Process is reward** - Time investment is part of the value, not obstacle
- **Systematic approach** - Document everything, backup 3-2-1, version control

### **Challenge Questions for Return**

**Re-examine these decisions with fresh eyes:**
1. **Structural analysis** - Has cherry been mathematically verified for cantilever loads?
2. **Scope reality** - Still aligned with actual needs vs. perfectionist desires?
3. **Timeline expectations** - Custom Ti fabrication time vs. project urgency?
4. **Cardboard insights** - What does full-scale mockup reveal about ergonomics?

### **Success Metrics for Next Phase**

**How to know you're on track:**
- **Vendor selected** with confidence in long-term support
- **Cardboard mockup** validates L-shape ergonomics and proportions
- **Structural analysis** confirms cherry adequacy or identifies alternatives
- **Templates created** for repeatable, precise cherry fabrication

### **Red Flags to Watch For**

**Warning signs to pause and reassess:**
- **Scope creep beyond functional requirements** - adding complexity for complexity's sake
- **Vendor responses lacking technical depth** - suggests future support issues  
- **Cardboard reveals ergonomic problems** - fundamental design issues
- **Structural math shows cherry inadequacy** - major redesign required

### **Resources for Continuation**

**Key references to review:**
- **Interior framework calculations** - Section above with all critical dimensions
- **Power distribution strategy** - Quarter system approach and current requirements
- **Material sourcing list** - Cherry, osage, titanium, leather specifications
- **Influencing factors** - Hip-hop authenticity philosophy, darkroom precision, aircraft reliability

### **Quick Re-engagement Checklist**

**First session back:**
□ Review vendor responses and make power supply decision
□ Assess any new insights from time away
□ Start cardboard mockup of most complex section (angular transitions)
□ Verify current module collection hasn't changed requirements
□ Check if any new "goofy ideas" emerged during break
