**The Otherworldly Reverberation Machine - A Wizard in a Cave**

---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Otherworldly Reverb Working in 5 Minutes

**What is Afterneath?** A 16HP digital reverb module that sounds like "a wizard in a cave" - featuring the unique **Drag** parameter that separates delay lines for stuttering, warped effects, plus 9 operational modes, extensive CV control, and self-oscillation capabilities.

### Your First Wizard Spell
1. **Connect audio input** - Patch audio source to Input jack, adjust Input knob for proper level
2. **Set basic reverb** - Start with Reflect at 12 o'clock, Length at 2 o'clock, Mix at 1 o'clock
3. **Engage the magic** - Slowly turn Drag knob while audio plays - witness the otherworldly warping
4. **Select curve type** - Toggle between Linear (LIN) and Exponential (XPO) - XPO sounds more natural
5. **Choose your realm** - Set Mode to position 1 (Unquantized) for smooth response

## Essential Parameters (The Wizard's Controls)

### **Core Reverb Controls:**
- **Input:** Adjusts level from instrument (CW) to modular (CCW)
- **Dampen:** Tone control - CW for darker, CCW for brighter reverb
- **Reflect:** Regeneration/feedback - push past 12 o'clock for self-oscillation
- **Mix:** Wet/dry balance - use with Dry Kill for 100% wet
- **Dry Kill (Switch):** Eliminates dry signal for send/return applications

### **The Magic Controls:**
- **Drag:** "The coolest control" - separates delay lines for warped, stuttering effects
- **Mode:** 9 different operational modes from smooth to quantized scales
- **Diffuse:** Smooths delay repeats - CCW sharp, CW ambient
- **Length:** Decay time - combines with Reflect for self-oscillation

### **CV Control:**
- **4 CV Inputs:** Drag, Mode, Diffuse, Length with dedicated inverting attenuators
- **Reflect Send/Return:** External processing loop for feedback path

## The 9 Operational Modes (The Realms of Response)

### **Unquantized Modes:**
- **Mode 1: Unquantized** - Smooth, natural response
- **Mode 2: Unquantized with Slew** - Tape delay-style lag behavior
- **Mode 3: Unquantized Volt/Octave** - 1V/oct scaling for VCO behavior

### **Quantized Scale Modes:**
- **Mode 4: Chromatic Scale** - All 12 semitones
- **Mode 5: Major Scale** - 7-note major scale tonality
- **Mode 6: Minor Scale** - 7-note minor scale tonality
- **Mode 7: Pentatonic Scale** - 5-note always-musical scale
- **Mode 8: Octaves & Fifths** - Only perfect consonances
- **Mode 9: Octaves** - Pure octave relationships only

**Bottom Line:** Afterneath isn't just a reverb - it's an **otherworldly texture generator** that transforms any audio into ambient, warped, and musical textures through its signature Drag parameter and 9 operational modes. From basic reverb to self-oscillating VCO to complex ambient processor, it brings unique character that's impossible to achieve with conventional reverbs. The Drag control alone makes it worth the 16HP, but the extensive CV control and external processing capabilities make it a **complete ambient sound design powerhouse**.

**Note:** This module deserves a comprehensive deep dive guide covering advanced techniques, mode-specific applications, external processing strategies, and professional ambient system integration.
