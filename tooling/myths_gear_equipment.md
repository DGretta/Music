# Gear & Equipment Myths

**Category:** Myths about gear acquisition, operation, and maintenance

These myths create confusion about gear needs, waste money on unnecessary purchases, and make people feel inadequate about their tools. They often stem from marketing, gatekeeping, or outdated practices.

## "You Should Leave Your Gear Powered On All The Time"

### **Why This Myth Persists:**

I believed this for years. Studio forum posts, vintage synth experts, even some manufacturers suggest it. The reasoning sounds solid: thermal stability matters for analog circuits, power-on surge stresses components, vintage gear was designed to stay on in professional studios.

**The compelling technical arguments:**
- "Components reach operating temperature and stabilize"
- "Turn-on surge current damages capacitors over time"
- "Studio professionals leave everything on 24/7"
- "Vintage circuits need warmup time for accurate tuning"

All of these sound authoritative. Some are even technically accurate in specific contexts.

### **The Kernel of Truth:**

There IS truth here - but it is context-dependent:

- **Analog circuits DO stabilize thermally** - 15-30 minute warmup improves tuning stability in precision analog circuits
- **Power-on surge CAN stress components** - especially vintage gear with aging capacitors designed for constant power
- **Studio professionals DID leave gear on** - when electricity was cheap (1970s-1980s) and studios ran 24/7 operations
- **Some critical equipment benefits from constant power** - mastering-grade converters, precision reference monitors

**This is not a myth because people made it up - it is a myth because context changed and the advice did not.**

### **What Actually Matters:**

**For vintage analog gear (1970s-1980s synthesizers, drum machines):**
- **Turn it off when not in use** - component life matters more than convenience
- Aging capacitors, transistors, and potentiometers degrade faster under constant power
- Heat accelerates electrolytic capacitor failure (the #1 vintage synth issue)
- Power consumption is high (vintage MS-20 draws substantial current continuously)
- **Exception:** If using daily for professional work, 15-30 minute warmup before critical sessions makes sense

**For modern gear (2000s+ synthesizers, interfaces, effects):**
- **Designed for power cycling** - modern components handle frequent on/off cycles without stress
- Energy efficiency standards mean low idle draw and smart power management
- Auto-off features exist for component longevity reasons (manufacturers know what they are doing)
- Solid-state components stabilize in seconds, not minutes
- **Exception:** Rack-mounted studio gear in constant professional use (mixing console, patchbays)

**For modular synthesizers:**
- **Turn off when not in use** - power supplies generate heat, modules cook in cases
- Heat buildup shortens LED life, accelerates capacitor aging, stresses regulators
- Fire risk with high-current power supplies left unattended
- Most modules stabilize thermally within 5-10 minutes
- **Exception:** Live performance setup during event (leave on for set, turn off after)

**For digital gear (samplers, grooveboxes, computers):**
- **Designed for sleep/wake cycles** - modern digital gear is optimized for power management
- Leaving on wastes electricity with zero sonic benefit (no thermal drift in digital circuits)
- Hard drives and fans wear from continuous operation
- **Exception:** Studio computer running DAW sessions (sleep mode when idle)

### **What This Teaches:**

**Understanding WHEN thermal stability matters vs component longevity:**
- Precision analog circuits benefit from warmup (oscillators, filters with tight tracking)
- But hours of idle power-on time ages components faster than power cycling
- Modern gear is designed for the way people actually work (power on, create, power off)
- Vintage gear was designed for studio operations that no longer exist economically

**The trade-off is not "always on" vs "always off" - it is understanding YOUR specific situation.**

### **The Real Question:**

**"How often do I use this, what is it, and does warmup time matter for my work?"**

**Daily professional use for critical work?**
- Warmup 15-30 minutes before session makes sense
- Turn off overnight and weekends
- Balance: warmup time vs component longevity

**Weekend hobby music-making?**
- Turn it off between sessions
- Modern gear: ready in seconds
- Vintage analog: 10-15 minute warmup is acceptable for the time you save on component life

**Vintage investment piece or rare instrument?**
- Minimize total power-on hours to preserve value and functionality
- Accept warmup time as part of using the instrument
- Component replacement is expensive and sometimes impossible

**Modern digital gear?**
- Designed for power cycling, just turn it off
- No warmup needed, no benefit to leaving on
- Wastes electricity and generates heat for zero gain

**Modular synthesizer case?**
- Always turn off when done (fire risk, heat buildup, power supply stress)
- 5-10 minute warmup is all you need for thermal stability
- Modules left on continuously age visibly faster (LED dimming, heat discoloration)

### **No One Should Feel Foolish:**

The "leave gear on" advice came from **real professional studio practices** when:
- Electricity was cheap (1970s-1980s rates)
- Studios operated 24/7 (multiple sessions per day)
- Gear was expected to run continuously (designed for that use case)
- Engineers valued instant availability over component longevity

**Times changed. Gear changed. Energy costs changed. How we work changed.**

The advice made sense then. It persists now because it still sounds technically credible and some people still cite "what the pros do" without understanding the context changed.

**You are not wrong for believing this - you just have better information now.**

## "Your Gear SUCKS!"

### **Why This Myth Persists (And Why It Is Pure Psychological Warfare):**

This is not a myth in the traditional sense - it is **weaponized inadequacy**. Unlike other myths that sound technically credible, "your gear sucks" is pure gatekeeping, pure ego defense, pure insecurity made verbal. I despise seeing this on forums or hearing it in person because it serves no purpose except to make someone feel inadequate.

**Why people say this:**
- **Insecurity** (making themselves feel superior)
- **Inability to give constructive feedback** (do not know what is actually wrong)
- **Tribal identity** ("my brand > your brand")
- **Compensating for lack of skill** (expensive gear = validation)
- **Forum posturing for status** (demonstrating "knowledge")
- **Need to justify their purchases** (if your cheap gear works, their expensive gear looks unnecessary)

**What it actually means when someone says this:**
- "I feel threatened"
- "I cannot articulate what is actually wrong"
- "I need to establish hierarchy"
- "I spent money and need to justify it"
- **NOT: useful information about your gear**

### **The Kernel of Truth:**

**Some gear IS objectively limited:**
- Cheap audio interfaces with high noise floors (measurable)
- Monitors with poor frequency response (measurable)
- MIDI controllers with bad build quality (mechanical failure)
- Software with bugs or missing features (functional limitations)

**These are specific, articulable limitations. Not "sucks."**

**BUT - this destroys the "your gear sucks" attack:**
- Most gear criticism is vague ("sounds bad" without specifics)
- Often about brand tribalism ("X brand sucks" without technical reasoning)
- Rarely actionable (no explanation of what specifically limits your work)
- Almost never considers YOUR music and YOUR needs
- **If someone cannot articulate WHAT is wrong and WHY it matters for YOUR music, they are not helping you**

### **What Actually Matters:**

**The only relevant question: Does your gear prevent you from making the music you want to make?**

**Specific gear limitations that might matter:**

**Audio interface:**
- **Noise floor too high** for quiet recordings (specific, measurable)
- **Latency too high** for real-time performance (specific, measurable)
- **Not enough inputs** for your setup (functional limitation)
- **Driver issues** causing crashes (technical problem)

**Monitors/headphones:**
- **Poor frequency response** misleading mixing decisions (measurable)
- **Room acoustics** making any monitors perform poorly (environmental)
- **Volume insufficient** for your needs (functional limitation)

**Instruments:**
- **Tuning stability issues** requiring constant retuning (functional problem)
- **Build quality** causing mechanical failures (practical concern)
- **Limited features** preventing techniques you want to use (specific limitation)

**DAW/software:**
- **Missing features** you specifically need (functional gap)
- **Workflow does not fit** your creative process (personal incompatibility)
- **Stability issues** causing data loss (technical problem)

**Notice: All of these are SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE. None are "sucks."**

**When gear does NOT matter:**

**Your skill level:**
- Beginner with $5000 interface sounds worse than experienced producer with $100 interface
- Expensive monitors in untreated room = waste of money
- Professional plugins in unskilled hands = still poor mixes
- **Skill >>> gear, always**

**Your music goals:**
- Lo-fi aesthetic? Expensive pristine gear works against you
- Harsh noise music? Audio interface noise floor is irrelevant
- Making beats in bedroom? Studio monitors unnecessary
- **Context determines what matters**

**Most common scenario:**
- Your gear is adequate for your current skill level
- Your limitations are skill-based, not gear-based
- Better gear would not improve your music yet
- **Upgrading gear feels like progress but delays actual learning**

### **What This Teaches:**

**Why "your gear sucks" is psychological warfare:**

**It creates self-doubt:**
- "Maybe my music sounds bad because of my gear" (misdirection)
- "Maybe I need to upgrade before I can be good" (false prerequisite)
- "Maybe I should stop until I can afford better" (delay tactic)
- **Shifts focus from learnable skills to expensive purchases**

**It cannot be refuted:**
- No specific claim to address ("what specifically is wrong?")
- No actionable feedback ("how does this limit MY music?")
- Just vague inadequacy ("it sucks" is not useful information)
- **Designed to make you feel bad, not to help you improve**

**It reveals the speaker's issues:**
- Cannot give constructive feedback (lack of teaching ability)
- Needs to feel superior (insecurity)
- Defines worth by gear (compensating for something)
- **This is about them, not you**

**What constructive feedback looks like:**

**Bad feedback (useless):**
- "Your gear sucks"
- "You need better stuff"
- "That interface is trash"
- "Pros do not use that"

**Good feedback (useful):**
- "I hear noise in your recordings - your interface noise floor might be too high for quiet sources"
- "Your low end is inconsistent - might be room acoustics or monitor frequency response"
- "Latency is affecting your timing - your interface buffer settings or drivers might need adjustment"
- "That synth lacks the filter type you are trying to use - here is what might work better"

**Notice: Good feedback is SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE, and CONSIDERS YOUR NEEDS.**

### **The Real Question:**

**"Is my gear actually limiting my music, or am I looking for external reasons for skill gaps?"**

**Honest self-assessment:**

**Signs gear is actually limiting you:**
- Specific feature you need is missing (not vague "better")
- Measurable problem affecting results (noise, latency, instability)
- Reached ceiling of what gear can do (maxed out inputs, processing)
- Workflow inefficiency from gear limitations (specific bottlenecks)

**Signs gear is not the problem:**
- Your music sounds worse than others using same or worse gear
- You cannot articulate what specific limitation you are hitting
- You think "upgrade" will automatically improve your music
- You are comparing your sound to professionals (skill gap, not gear gap)
- **Most common case: Skill development will help more than gear upgrades**

**The decision framework:**

**Before upgrading gear, ask:**
1. **What specific limitation am I hitting?** (not vague "better")
2. **How does this limit MY music specifically?** (not theoretical)
3. **Would better skill overcome this?** (usually yes)
4. **Is this actually the next bottleneck?** (or are other skills more limiting?)
5. **Can I articulate exactly what I need?** (if no, not ready to upgrade)

**If you can answer all five clearly, upgrade might help.**
**If you cannot, develop skills first.**

### **No One Should Feel Their Gear Makes Them Inadequate:**

The "your gear sucks" attack persists because:
- **Insecure people need to feel superior** (easiest target is gear)
- **Gear tribalism creates identity** ("I am a [brand] person")
- **Expensive gear provides validation** ("I am serious because I spent money")
- **Online forums reward gatekeeping** (status from appearing knowledgeable)
- **Cannot admit skill gaps** (easier to blame gear than practice)

But here is what destroys this myth: **Incredible music has been made on gear people say "sucks."**

**Examples:**
- **Burial:** Produced genre-defining dubstep in Sound Forge (basic software)
- **Deadmau5 early work:** Fruity Loops (now FL Studio, once dismissed as "toy")
- **Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails):** Used whatever was available, focused on ideas
- **Countless bedroom producers:** Making professional-quality music on "beginner" gear
- **Your favorite artist's first album:** Probably made on less than you have now

**The truth about professional gear:**
- Pros use expensive gear because they can afford it (not because it is required)
- They would still make good music on your gear (skill transfers)
- They started on cheap gear too (everyone does)
- Their music is good because of skill, not gear (gear enables, does not create)

**What you probably have:**
- Adequate audio interface (anything from this century)
- Adequate monitoring (headphones or speakers)
- Adequate DAW (free ones are incredibly capable)
- Adequate computer (if it runs the DAW, it works)
- **This is enough to learn and create**

**What you probably need:**
- Time practicing (makes bigger difference than new gear)
- Better acoustic treatment (if mixing, more important than expensive monitors)
- Education/tutorials (YouTube, courses - cheaper than gear)
- Focused skill development (mixing, arrangement, sound design)
- **None of these are gear upgrades**

**When someone says "your gear sucks":**

**Ask yourself:**
1. Can they articulate what specifically is wrong? (if no, ignore)
2. Does this limitation affect MY music? (if no, ignore)
3. Are they offering solutions or just criticizing? (if just criticizing, ignore)
4. Do they seem insecure or genuinely helpful? (tone matters)

**Response options:**
1. **Ignore completely** (usually best - do not engage with gatekeepers)
2. **Ask for specifics** ("What specifically limits my music?")
3. **Show them great work on "bad" gear** (Burial, FL Studio, etc.)
4. **Focus on your music** (results matter, gear does not)

**What you should say to yourself:**
- "My gear is adequate for my current skill level"
- "I will upgrade when I hit specific limitations"
- "Skill development > gear acquisition"
- "Results matter, not brand names"
- **"I am making music, not collecting status symbols"**

**The ultimate response to "your gear sucks":**

**Make great music anyway.**

Prove gear is not the limitation. Prove skill matters more. Prove they are wrong by creating.

**Your gear does not suck. Their feedback sucks.**

If they cannot tell you WHAT specifically is wrong, WHY it matters for YOUR music, and HOW to improve - they are not helping. They are posturing.

**Find better teachers. They exist.**

Good teachers:
- Give specific, actionable feedback
- Respect your current gear and budget
- Focus on developing your skills
- Help you maximize what you have
- Celebrate your progress

Bad teachers:
- Vague criticism without specifics
- Dismiss your gear categorically
- Make you feel inadequate
- Push expensive "solutions"
- Never satisfied with your progress

**You deserve good teachers. Your gear is fine. Your skill is developing. Keep creating.**
