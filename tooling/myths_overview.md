# Music Gear Myths - Overview & Framework

**Purpose:** Address harmful myths that waste beginners' time, money, and creative energy. Not cynical debunking - empathetic teaching that explains WHY myths persist and WHAT actually matters.

---

## Philosophy

**"These myths persist because they sound technically credible and serve someone's interests - usually not yours."**

This document exists because:
- **Myths actively harm beginners** - wasted money, frustration, quitting
- **Information overload makes truth hard to find** - contradictory forum posts, gatekeeping experts, marketing disguised as advice
- **No one should feel foolish** - we all believed these myths when we lacked context
- **Understanding beats procedures** - teach WHY myths are compelling, WHEN they apply, WHAT actually matters

---

## Framework for Each Myth

Every myth follows this empathetic structure:

1. **Why This Myth Persists** - Acknowledge it sounds credible (because it often is, in specific contexts)
2. **The Kernel of Truth** - What is actually true about this claim (myths are rarely 100% false)
3. **What Actually Matters** - Context-dependent answer with technical understanding
4. **What This Teaches** - Underlying principle that transfers to other situations
5. **The Real Question** - Decision framework for your specific situation
6. **No Shame Closing** - Empathetic acknowledgment of why people believe this

**Tone Guidelines:**
- Never "you are stupid for believing this"
- Always "I believed this too, here is what I learned"
- Not binary (true/false) but contextual (when/where/why)
- Technical accuracy without condescension
- Practical decision frameworks, not just debunking

## How This Serves the Project

**Alignment with project philosophy:**
- **"Understanding transfers, procedures don't"** - Teach WHY myths persist, not just "this is wrong"
- **"Teach interconnection, not just features"** - Each myth connects to underlying principles
- **"Process over product"** - Helps people focus on creating, not acquiring
- **"Method allows all other things"** - Critical thinking framework prevents future myths

**Generational transmission:**
- Children and mentees learn to question marketing
- "Here is what I learned so you don't waste years"
- Decision frameworks they can apply to new situations
- No shame, just better information

**This document prevents harm while teaching understanding.**

## Adding New Myths

**When you encounter a myth worth documenting:**

1. **Is it actively harmful?** Does it waste money, time, or creative energy?
2. **Is it widespread?** Do beginners encounter this repeatedly?
3. **Can we teach principles?** Does debunking it create opportunity to explain interconnection?
4. **Can we be empathetic?** Is there a reason people believe this beyond stupidity?

**If yes to all four, add it to the appropriate category file following the framework template.**
