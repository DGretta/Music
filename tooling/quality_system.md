# Quality System

**Systematic framework for data accuracy verification and guide quality assurance**

---

## **Quality as Teaching Obligation**

Quality equals teaching correctly. From `framework_overview.md`: mistakes compound across generations. One inaccurate guide teaches Future Claude bad patterns, teaches users wrong information, degrades system integrity.

**Why accuracy matters beyond immediate use:** `project_philosophy.md` establishes generational teaching obligation - these guides must work when we're not present, for users in 2075 who want to understand how 21st century music technology functioned. Accuracy is how we honor that obligation.

**System integrity through verification:** `framework_overview.md` principle applied - systematic verification maintains documentation quality the same way `workflow_checklist.md` maintains process quality. Both serve the same purpose: preventing degradation through disciplined process.

**Interconnection principle in quality:** From `project_philosophy.md` - everything connects. One inaccurate jack name affects every patch that references it, every guide that cross-references this one, every user who builds on this knowledge. Quality verification prevents error propagation.

**How to verify:** `verification_strategy.md` provides systematic methodology for ensuring accuracy.

## **Core Quality Philosophy**

**Quality is accuracy:** Every guide must precisely reflect manufacturer specifications, interface layouts, and operational characteristics. Users rely on guides when modules aren't physically present - accuracy is non-negotiable.

### **ðŸ”§ Verification Process Protocol**

**Before Guide Publication:**
1. **Locate official manual** - manufacturer PDF, website documentation, or printed manual
2. **Cross-reference every interface element** - jack by jack, knob by knob verification
3. **Verify technical specifications** - power, voltage, frequency ranges against official specs
4. **Check operational descriptions** - ensure guide instructions match manual procedures
5. **Validate configuration details** - settings, modes, and special functions accurately described
6. **COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK COMPLIANCE** - verify ALL documented standards (added 2025-09-22)
   - **GitHub image integration** with proper format and caption
   - **Enhanced format alternatives** in every patch (budget/premium/different character)
   - **Terminology consistency** - "Advanced" not "Phase 2" throughout guide
   - **Language standards** - circuit-based descriptions, manufacturer terminology
   - **Visual standards** - signal coding, ASCII symbols, module boxes
   - **Educational progression** - clear learning objectives and skill milestones
   - **Historical context appropriateness** - when educationally valuable
   - **Cross-reference functionality** - all guide links work correctly

**Documentation Sources (Priority Order):**
1. **Official manufacturer manual** (primary source)
2. **Manufacturer website technical specs** (secondary)
3. **ModularGrid verified specifications** (tertiary reference)
4. **Community documentation** (reference only, must verify against official sources)

**Verification Tracking:**
- **Source document identification** - which manual version, date, or website used
- **Verification date** - when accuracy check was completed
- **Reviewer identification** - who performed the verification
- **Update tracking** - when guide was last checked against current manual

### **ðŸ”§ Visual Quality Assurance Process**

**Image Source Verification:**
1. **ModularGrid community images** (preferred - established practice)
2. **Manufacturer official images** (acceptable with proper attribution)
3. **Community contributed photos** (verify accuracy against manual)
4. **Reject generic or inaccurate representations** (no stock photos or mismatched modules)

**Integration Quality Check:**
- **GitHub raw URL format** - proper repository structure and branch reference
- **Display testing** - images render correctly in guide context
- **Mobile compatibility** - images scale appropriately on different devices
- **Loading performance** - file sizes optimized for reasonable load times

## **Quality Philosophy Summary**

**Accuracy is foundational** - users must be able to trust guide information completely when modules aren't physically available. **Systematic verification** prevents accuracy issues before publication rather than fixing them after user reports. **Visual references provide crucial quality** through known-good representations that users can rely on for interface recognition and operational understanding.

**Quality verification is part of systematic excellence** - it integrates with accountability frameworks to ensure reliable, accurate, and useful guide development that serves users effectively.
