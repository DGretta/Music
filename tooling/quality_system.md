# Sustainable Guide Quality System

## Prevention Framework

### 1. Pre-Writing Protocol
- [ ] Manual downloaded and reviewed
- [ ] I/O reference sheet updated  
- [ ] High-res module photos available
- [ ] Common misconceptions noted

### 2. Writing Standards
- **Use exact terminology** from module manuals
- **Never assume standard naming** (gate vs trigger vs trig)
- **Specify assignable CV behavior** explicitly
- **Include "Does NOT have" sections** for common assumptions

### 3. Quality Gates
- [ ] Guide checker script passes
- [ ] Patch examples reference only verified I/O
- [ ] Cross-references with I/O database
- [ ] Peer review for complex modules

### 4. Maintenance System
- **Monthly:** Run checker on all guides
- **Quarterly:** Review high-usage guides  
- **When reported:** Immediate fix + prevention analysis

## Sustainable Workload
- **New guides:** +30 minutes for verification
- **Existing guides:** Batch verification over 2-3 weeks
- **Maintenance:** ~2 hours/month ongoing
- **User confusion prevented:** Immeasurable

## Success Metrics
- Zero user-reported I/O errors
- 100% guide checker pass rate
- Complete I/O reference database
- Template adoption for new guides
- **User validation feedback:** Direct user approval confirms quality delivery
