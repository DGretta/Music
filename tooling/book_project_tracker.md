# Book Project Tracker

**Project:** Modular Synthesis Teaching Book
**Status:** Planning & Parallel Development
**Started:** December 2025

---

## Project Philosophy

**Primary Motivation:** Teaching obligation - sharing knowledge across formats (digital, in-person, written/published). Not profit-driven. The goal is helping everyone with even small interest in modular synthesis understand it from the ground up.

**Core Principle:** Teach interconnection, not procedures. Show WHY and HOW things work, not just WHAT buttons to press.

**Target Outcome:** Being known as someone who helps. Ground-up modular education that's accessible to absolute beginners.

---

## Module Selection Criteria

**Established Manufacturers Focus:**
- Doepfer (foundational, widely available)
- Make Noise (innovative, well-documented)
- Erica Synths (quality, accessible)
- Intellijel (professional grade)
- Mutable Instruments (even though discontinued - too important to skip)
- Other established brands with longevity

**Selection Principles:**
- Must be foundational pieces that teach transferable concepts
- Widely available with long-term market presence
- Skip tiny one-person operations (except notable exceptions)
- Include important discontinued modules (Plaits, Rings, etc.) - legacy matters

**Categories to Cover:**
- VCOs (voltage-controlled oscillators)
- Filters (VCFs)
- VCAs (voltage-controlled amplifiers)
- Envelope Generators
- LFOs and Modulation Sources
- Maths (non-negotiable - too foundational)
- Sequencers
- Effects
- Utilities

**Format Pattern:**
- Module Type (general function explanation)
- Module Example (specific implementation)
- Notable Mentions (discontinued but important alternatives)

Example: "VCOs work like this [principle], here's Plaits as an example, also consider Instruo Cs-L [alternative]"

## Diagram Standards

**Approach:** Top-down case view with simplified module representations

**Tools:**
- Primary: draw.io or Affinity Designer (vector/layout software)
- Production-quality diagrams, not sketches

**Visual Design:**
- Simplified module boxes (white background, approximate jack locations)
- NO photo overlays (too messy with cable routing)
- Clear jack labeling
- Color coding system:
  - CV = [color TBD - maybe blue]
  - Audio = [color TBD - maybe red/orange]
  - Gate/Trigger = [color TBD - maybe yellow/green]

**Routing Clarity:**
- Explicit "Jack A on Module X → Jack B on Module Y" instructions
- Visual lines showing cable paths
- Numbered/lettered steps for complex patches

**To Develop:**
- Template for standard module representations
- Reusable component library
- Consistent sizing/spacing standards

---

## Content Structure & Complexity

**Progressive Learning Model:**
- Start as simply as possible
- Every page assumes ONLY what came before
- Continuously build: terms → patches → principles
- No knowledge assumptions beyond what we've taught

**Teaching Pattern: Evergreen + Concrete**

Format for each concept:
1. **General Principle** - "VCO → Filter → VCA → Effects" (signal flow concept)
2. **Specific Example** - "Castor & Pollux → Forbidden Planet → Black VCA2 → Ghost" (concrete implementation)

This dual approach teaches:
- WHY it works (transferable understanding)
- HOW to implement it (practical application)

**Acknowledge Change:**
- Markets evolve, modules get discontinued
- Focus on principles that outlast specific products
- Plan for periodic updates (see Maintenance Strategy)

---

## Book Structure (Proposed)

**Working Length:** 250-300 pages

### Part 1: Before You Start (40-50 pages)
- 00: Before You Buy Anything ✓ (already written)

- NOT comprehensive coverage - selective teaching examples
- Mix of categories (oscillators, filters, modulators, effects, utilities, sequencers)

### Part 3: Patching Studies (60-80 pages)
- Progressive complexity patches with full diagrams
- Each patch teaches a specific principle
- Demonstrate: SAME sequence through different processing = different results
- Show how changing one connection transforms output

### Part 4: System Thinking (30-40 pages)
- Case study: building a complete system
- Possible focus: 280HP travel case as working example
- Power management strategies
- Module selection rationale
- Addressing common gaps
- System evolution over time

### Part 5: Reference (20-30 pages)
- Glossary of terms
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Resources for continued learning
- Quick-reference tables
- Index

## Economics & Distribution

**Pricing Philosophy:**
- NOT profit-driven - teaching obligation is primary motivation
- Break-even model: cover printing, shipping, tools/software/hosting
- No subsidy from author, but no profit extraction either

**Target Price Range:** $30-45 USD
- Comparable music books (Patch & Tweak) run $75+
- Want accessibility without asking author to subsidize
- Final pricing depends on page count and production costs

**Distribution Options:**
- Amazon KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) - print-on-demand
  - No upfront costs
  - No inventory burden
  - ~60% royalty after printing costs
  - Wide distribution

**Format Options to Consider:**
- Print-only (physical reference for patching)
- Print + bundled PDF (buy one, get both)
- Separate digital PDF (Gumroad, own site) for lower price point

**Status:** Distribution strategy to be finalized closer to completion

---

## Maintenance Strategy

**Update Cadence:** Every 3-4 years

**Rationale:**
- Modular market moves fast (new modules, discontinued classics)
- Principles remain evergreen, but examples age
- Regular updates maintain relevance without constant churn

**Version Management:**
- Each edition clearly dated
- Maintain online errata/supplement between editions
- GitHub documentation remains living/current reference
- Book is snapshot of knowledge at publication date

**Approach:**
- Focus on evergreen principles over specific products where possible
- When citing specific modules, acknowledge potential obsolescence
- Structure content so core teaching survives product changes

---

## Development Approach

**Phase 1: Complete Basics Series** (Current)
- Finish guides 01-04 (Making Sound, Controlling Sound, Musical Phrases, Rhythm/Percussion)
- Write with book structure in mind
- Each guide becomes book chapter
- Test explanations, gather feedback

**Phase 2: Book Structure Planning** (After Basics)
- Map Part 2 module selections (which 15-20 teach best?)
- Define Part 3 patching studies (which patches demonstrate principles?)
- Outline Part 4 system thinking case study (280HP travel case?)
- Finalize title

**Phase 3: Diagram Standards Development**
- Create module representation templates
- Establish color coding system
- Build reusable component library in draw.io/Affinity
- Develop consistent sizing/spacing standards

**Phase 4: Module Content Adaptation**
- Restructure existing module guides for book format
- Add evergreen principle sections
- Create corresponding diagrams
- Integrate with patching studies

**Phase 5: Production & Publishing**
- Layout and formatting
- Editing and revision
- Cover design
- Publishing setup (KDP, pricing, distribution)

**Current Status:** Phase 1 - Basics Series in progress (00 complete, 01 next)

---

## Time Investment Estimates

**Realistic Assessment:**
- Content restructuring: 100+ hours
- Diagram creation: 50+ hours
- Layout/formatting: 20+ hours
- Editing/revision: Unknown hours
- **Total: 170+ hours minimum**

**Philosophy:** This is continuation of work already committed to, just in different form. The teaching happens regardless—book is another transmission vector.

---

## Success Metrics

**Not About ROI:**
- Sales numbers don't matter ($0.00 is acceptable)
- Profit is not a consideration

**What Matters:**
- Reaching people beyond immediate community
- Teaching across multiple formats (digital, in-person, written)
- Helping beginners avoid expensive mistakes
- Building understanding through interconnection principles
- Leaving teaching legacy that outlasts the author
- Being known as someone who helps

**Long-term Goal:** Ground-up modular education accessible to anyone with even small interest.

## Open Questions

**To Be Resolved:**

1. **Part 2 Module Selection:** Which specific 15-20 modules best demonstrate principles?
2. **Part 3 Patch Studies:** Which patches teach which principles most effectively?
3. **Part 4 Case Study:** 280HP travel case or different system example?
4. **Diagram Color Scheme:** Finalize CV/Audio/Gate color coding
5. **Title:** Workshop as content develops
6. **Cover Design:** Style, imagery, aesthetic approach
7. **ISBN/Copyright:** Registration requirements, licensing decisions
8. **Distribution Mix:** Print-only, print+PDF bundle, or separate offerings?

## Notes & Context

**Background:**
- Author has 952HP eurorack system
- Extensive documentation already exists (500+ modules, tooling, frameworks)
- Basics series (00-04) being developed for GitHub, will form book foundation
- Teaching approach: interconnection over procedures, WHY over WHAT
- Strong commitment to teaching obligation and generational knowledge transmission

**Key Insight from Discussion:**
"The work we are doing may never end, why not add one more thing to the list? Having the ability to teach across more formats... seems valuable and a worthwhile effort."

**Motivation:**
Not recognition or profit—ensuring knowledge compounds correctly across generations. Book is just another transmission vector for reaching learners where they are.
