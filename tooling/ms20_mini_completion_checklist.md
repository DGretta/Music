# MS-20 Mini Guide Completion Checklist

**Status:** Partially updated - Mini identification complete, full enhancement needed

**Completed:**
- ✅ Title updated to "MS-20 Mini"
- ✅ "About This Guide" section added (Mini vs Vintage)
- ✅ Patch jack size difference noted (3.5mm vs 1/4")
- ✅ Eurorack compatibility explained
- ✅ Filter difference flagged for verification

**Still Needed (following guide_enhancement_pattern.md):**

## 1. Common Mistakes Section
Need 8-12 Mini-specific issues:
- [ ] **Mini-keys ergonomics:** "Keys feel too small/cramped"
  - Why: 86% scale, not full size
  - Solution: Adaptation techniques, external MIDI controller option
  
- [ ] **USB MIDI not working:** Configuration issues
  - Why: Driver requirements, class-compliant vs specific drivers
  - Solution: Computer setup, troubleshooting steps
  
- [ ] **Patch cable size confusion:** Wrong cable type
  - Why: Mini uses 3.5mm (Eurorack), not 1/4" (vintage synth standard)
  - Solution: Use Eurorack cables, adapters for vintage gear
  
- [ ] **Filter doesn't sound like vintage:** Character expectations
  - Why: Modern components, slight circuit differences
  - Solution: Realistic expectations, embrace Mini character
  
- [ ] **ESP seems weak/different:** Comparing to vintage
  - Why: Circuit tolerances may differ slightly
  - Solution: Adjust expectations, use differently
  
- [ ] **External CV not tracking:** Voltage mismatch
  - Why: MS-20 uses Hz/V not V/Oct standard
  - ⚠️ Verify: Check if Mini still uses Hz/V like vintage
  
- [ ] **Self-oscillation issues:** Resonance behavior
  - Why: Filter self-osc technique requires practice
  - Solution: Proper technique explanation
  
- [ ] **MIDI velocity not working:** Settings issue
  - Why: Must enable velocity response in settings
  - Solution: Configuration walkthrough
  
- [ ] **Compact panel hard to see:** Label legibility
  - Why: 86% scale makes text smaller
  - Solution: Good lighting, label overlay options
  
- [ ] **Integration with DAW:** USB MIDI workflow
  - Why: Setup complexity, proper configuration needed
  - Solution: Step-by-step DAW integration

## 2. Why This Instrument Excels Section

Need to explain:
- **Why Mini is better than buying vintage** (price, reliability, USB MIDI)
- **Why 86% scale is acceptable trade-off** (portability, desk space)
- **Why Eurorack compatibility matters** (modern integration)
- **Why vintage character is preserved** (circuit analysis)
- **Perfect for** section (modern producers, not just collectors)

## 3. USB MIDI Integration Details

Add comprehensive section on:
- **Why USB MIDI is game-changer** for Mini vs vintage
- **How to configure** in various DAWs
- **MIDI note range** and keyboard mapping
- **Velocity sensitivity** setup
- **MIDI clock sync** for tempo-locked modulation
- **Program changes** if supported
- **What goes wrong** with USB MIDI (common issues)

## 4. Modern Workflow Integration

Explain:
- **DAW integration** advantages of Mini
- **Plugin comparison** (MS-20 Mini hardware vs software emulations)
- **Hybrid workflows** (recording, resampling, external processing)
- **Why hardware still matters** despite plugins

## 5. Update References

Replace throughout:
- [ ] "Phase 2 Learning Path" → "Advanced Learning Path"
- [ ] Update cultural references (Mini in modern productions, not just vintage)
- [ ] Note Daft Punk used vintage, but Mini achieves similar results
- [ ] Add modern producers using MS-20 Mini

## 6. Verification Items

Technical claims needing verification:
- ⚠️ **Filter circuit:** Exact differences between Mini and vintage
- ⚠️ **Hz/V vs V/Oct:** Confirm Mini still uses Hz/V keyboard tracking
- ⚠️ **USB MIDI specs:** Class-compliant or requires drivers?
- ⚠️ **MIDI implementation:** Note range, velocity, program changes
- ⚠️ **ESP differences:** Any circuit changes from vintage?
- ⚠️ **Calibration:** Mini calibration procedures vs vintage

## 7. Pattern Recognition Section

Add to Common Mistakes:
"Most MS-20 Mini problems come from:
1. Expecting vintage exact match (accept Mini character)
2. Wrong patch cable size (3.5mm not 1/4\")
3. Mini-keys unfamiliarity (adapt or use external controller)
4. USB MIDI misconfiguration (proper driver/DAW setup)
5. Not leveraging modern advantages (USB MIDI, Eurorack compatibility)"

## Estimated Work

- **Common Mistakes:** 1-2 hours (10 issues with WHY explanations)
- **Why This Excels:** 30-45 minutes (Mini-focused advantages)
- **USB MIDI Details:** 30-45 minutes (modern integration)
- **Updates/Verification:** 30 minutes (terminology, flagging)

**Total:** 3-4 hours to complete following established pattern

## Next Session Start Point

Begin with Common Mistakes section using guide_enhancement_pattern.md template.
Focus on Mini-specific issues that differ from vintage experience.
