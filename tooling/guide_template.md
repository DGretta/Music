# Module Guide Template

## Pre-Writing Checklist
- [ ] Module manual reviewed for exact I/O names
- [ ] Physical module inspected (or high-res photos analyzed)
- [ ] I/O reference sheet updated
- [ ] Common misconceptions noted

## Required Sections

### Module I/O Verification
**Verified Inputs:** [List exactly as they appear on module]
**Verified Outputs:** [List exactly as they appear on module]
**Does NOT have:** [List commonly assumed but absent I/O]

### Enhanced Patch Examples Format
For each patch, use the enhanced format with module suggestions:

```
Source Category (Module A, Module B, Module C) → exact jack name (function description)
LFO (Batumi, Ochd, Pamela's NEW) → cvf ● (filter control)
Envelope (Maths, Function, Contour) → vca ● (amplitude control)
Output ← lp ●, lp ●● → Mixer (Mixup, Performance)
```

**Module Suggestion Guidelines:**
- **Include 3-4 alternatives** per category (budget to premium)
- **Mix price points** - from 2HP modules to high-end options
- **Show HP variety** - different case space requirements
- **Use commonly available modules** - avoid rare/discontinued
- **Specify exact channels** when relevant (Maths Ch1, Batumi Ch2)

**Alternative Format (immediately after main patch):**
```
**Alternative Module Options:**
- **Instead of [Main Module]:** Try [Alternative A] for [different character], or [Alternative B] for [budget option]
- **Budget alternatives:** [Specific low-cost options] provides similar functionality
- **Different character:** [Alternative approach] creates [distinct musical result]
```

- **Note:** [Any special triggering/timing behavior]
- **Not:** [What this module doesn't do/have]

## Common Error Prevention

### Avoid These Assumptions:
1. **"All modules have gate inputs"** - Many don't
2. **"CV inputs are generic"** - Many are specific/assignable
3. **"Standard naming"** - Each manufacturer uses different terms
4. **"Users know what modules to use"** - Always provide specific suggestions
5. **"Generic patch format is sufficient"** - Use enhanced format with alternatives

### Validation Questions:
- Does this input/output actually exist on the module?
- Is this the exact name printed on the module?
- Have I tested this connection or verified it exists?
- Have I provided actionable module suggestions?
- Are alternatives accessible at different price points?

### Module Suggestion Standards:
**Essential Categories to Include:**
- **Audio Sources:** VCOs, samples, noise (Plaits, Braids, Elements)
- **Modulation:** LFOs, envelopes, chaos (Batumi, Ochd, Maths, Function)
- **Processing:** Filters, effects, VCAs (various manufacturers)
- **Utilities:** Multiples, mixers, attenuators (Links, Doepfer, 2HP)
- **Sequencing:** Clock, gates, CV (Pamela's, Hermod+, Metropolix)

**Price Point Balance:**
- **Budget:** 2HP modules, Doepfer basics, DIY options
- **Mid-range:** Popular modules like Maths, Plaits, Batumi
- **Premium:** Boutique and flagship modules where appropriate

## Post-Writing Checklist
- [ ] All patch examples use verified I/O only
- [ ] No references to non-existent inputs/outputs
- [ ] Enhanced format with module suggestions used throughout
- [ ] Alternative options provided for different budgets/HP
- [ ] Guide checker script run with no errors
- [ ] Cross-referenced with module manual
