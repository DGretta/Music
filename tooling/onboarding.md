# Onboarding: Start Here

**Read this first. Takes ~5 minutes. Then you're ready to work.**

## What This Project Is

This is **knowledge transmission architecture** for ~500 musical instruments. Not user manuals. Not gear reviews.

**Why it exists:** Teaching new users, beginners, and future collaborators how to understand music technology across generations. Teaching interconnection—how everything relates—not just "how to press buttons."

**Timeline:** Generational. Your work teaches future Claudes. Their work teaches mentees. The knowledge compounds.

**Format:** Plain text (markdown) for durability. GitHub-hosted. Always evolving.

## How Work Happens Here

### The Four Non-Negotiables

**1. Ask before you do**
- Close-ended questions = information-seeking, not action requests
- "Should I proceed with [approach]?" gets yes/no, then you execute
- Never assume what needs to happen—ask

**2. Complete the workflow checklist before any file operation**
- 8 steps. Takes 5 minutes. Mandatory every time.
- Not bureaucracy. It's mise en place (professional kitchen discipline applied to knowledge work).
- See `workflow_checklist.md` for the checklist itself.

**3. Teach interconnection, not procedures**
- WHY does this design exist? (not WHAT buttons do it have?)
- HOW do mechanisms work? (not WHEN do I press them?)
- WHEN does this approach apply? (context, not isolated facts)
- Shows how everything relates.

**4. Document what you verify, flag what you're uncertain about**
- Specific technical claims (voltage ranges, timing specs, firmware features) need verification or flags
- Use ⚠️ format for uncertain specifications
- Wrong specs multiply across generations—accuracy matters

---

## Who You're Working With

**Direct and efficient**
- Specific corrections when needed
- Earned praise when earned
- "Proceed, please" = execute
- No hedging or excessive politeness

**Never assume their intent**
- Ask for clarification if unclear
- Don't guess about priorities
- Don't fill in gaps

**No sycophants, but collaborative**
- Challenge ideas when needed
- Provide honest feedback
- Disagree if you see a better approach
- They want thinking partners, not yes-machines

**Creator context matters**
- Paramedic → IT Architect → Chef (backgrounds inform thinking)
- ~500 instruments (and builds studio furniture quarterly)
- Multiple musical genres (house to drill to Marty Robbins)
- Creates daily ("I must create things, everyday")
- Thinks on geologic timescales

---

## The Workflow (Every Session)

### Step 1: Understand Context
```
Ask: "What would you like to work on today?"
Or: "What jumped out when you walked by?"
```
Listen to priorities. Don't assume.

### Step 2: Read Existing Work (if applicable)
- If guide exists, read it
- Identify what's missing or incomplete
- Note any technical claims that need verification

### Step 3: Complete Workflow Checklist
- File analysis requirements (1-2 minutes)
- Change scope definition (2-3 minutes)
- Efficiency estimation (1 minute)
- Pre-execution verification (1 minute)
- Show user the completed checklist (mandatory wait for approval)

See `workflow_checklist.md` for the full checklist.

### Step 4: Execute (only after approval)
- Make changes as planned
- Verify technical claims or flag with ⚠️
- Commit with clear message explaining what changed and why

### Step 5: Document Completion
- If done: note successful completion
- If partial: create completion checklist for next session
- Update accountability tracker (see `accountability_tracking.md`)

## Essential Standards

### Guide Structure
Every enhanced guide should have:
- **Why This Instrument Excels** - philosophy + practical benefits + the magic (emotional essence)
- **Common Mistakes** - 8-12 issues with WHY explanations (frustrated first-person quotes as headings)
- **Technical Accuracy** - flag uncertain specs with ⚠️, verify others
- **Advanced Learning Path** - progression framework (not just "Phase 2")

See `guide_creation_framework.md` for complete requirements.

### Efficiency Standards
- Most operations: 1-2 function calls
- 3+ calls need explicit justification
- Common operations (guide enhancement): ~5-6 calls following proven patterns
- Git commits count toward total

See `workflow_checklist.md` "Updated Estimation Standards" for specifics.

### Technical Verification
**Flag these with ⚠️ if uncertain:**
- Voltage ranges (e.g., "-5V to +5V")
- Timing specs (e.g., "500ms")
- Firmware features (e.g., "requires v1.1+")
- Compatibility specs (e.g., "32GB SD max")
- Resistance values (e.g., "1kΩ to 100kΩ")

**These are safe without verification:**
- Conceptual explanations (WHY filters work)
- General synthesis principles (1V/octave standard)
- Common issues (loose clips create noise)
- Musical context (good for bass, leads, pads)

## When to Read More

**Read these when you need depth:**

| You need... | Read this |
|---|---|
| **Deep philosophy** - WHY this matters | `project_philosophy.md` |
| **Framework understanding** - HOW to think systematically | `framework_overview.md` |
| **Enhancement process** - HOW to enhance guides specifically | `guide_creation_framework.md` |
| **Creator context** - WHO they are, working patterns | `session_continuity_guide.md` |
| **Technical specs** - WHAT instruments need | Specific guide files |

**Don't read these now** - reference them as needed:
- `accountability_tracking.md` (if you're optimizing efficiency or learning patterns)
- `quality_system.md` (if verifying technical accuracy)
- `visual_communication_standards.md` (if adding images)

## Common Patterns

### What Usually Happens
1. Creator identifies next instrument ("one jumped out")
2. Read existing guide, identify gaps
3. Discuss approach (ask questions, don't assume)
4. Execute enhancements following workflow checklist
5. Verify technical claims or flag ⚠️
6. Commit with descriptive message

### When to Ask Questions
- "Should I proceed with [approach]?"
- "I'm uncertain about [technical detail] - can you verify?"
- "I notice [issue] - should we [solution]?"
- "Which would you prefer: [option A] or [option B]?"

### When to Stop
- Token budget ~30k remaining (wrap up)
- Natural completion point reached
- Creator satisfaction achieved
- Technical verification needed before continuing

### What to Document
- Completion checklists for partial work
- Verification items flagged with ⚠️
- Pattern improvements discovered
- Framework updates needed

## The Philosophy in One Sentence

**Everything is connected. Document accordingly.**

If you want to understand deeper: Why generational thinking, why interconnection matters, why process discipline prevents disaster—read `project_philosophy.md`. It explains the worldview that makes all of this make sense.

But you don't need that to start working. You need:
- Ask before you do
- Complete the checklist
- Teach interconnection
- Verify or flag technical claims

---

## Right Now

**You're ready.**

Ask: "What would you like to work on today?"

Then follow the workflow.

If you get stuck or uncertain, this checklist applies:
1. Ask for clarification (don't assume)
2. Read the relevant doc linked above
3. Complete workflow checklist before proceeding
4. When in doubt, flag it and keep moving

---

## Terminology Quick Reference

**Teaching Obligation** - When you learn, you inherit the duty to teach others correctly. Knowledge compounds across generations.

**Mise en Place** - Professional kitchen discipline: prep everything before service gets chaotic. Applied here: complete workflow steps before execution gets complex.

**Interconnection** - Everything relates to everything. Guides show HOW. Teaching understanding (not procedures) reveals connections.

**Enhanced Format** - Guides go beyond "how to use" to "why it works this way and what connections exist."

**Generational Timeframe** - This documentation outlasts its creators. Think in timescales of lifetimes and decades.

**Holistic vs. Tactical** - Tactical: complete this task efficiently. Holistic: complete this task while maintaining system integrity for all future work.

---

## Emergency Reference

**If everything is chaos, remember:**

1. Ask questions before assuming
2. Complete the workflow checklist
3. Verify or flag technical claims
4. When stuck, reference the doc that matches your question

**If you only remember one thing:**

**Teach interconnection, not procedures.**
