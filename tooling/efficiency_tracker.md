- **Major violations:** 0 (workflow checklist followed throughout)

## **Historical Pattern Analysis**

### **Repeated Failures:**
1. **Claiming single operation, delivering multiple:** Every recent session
2. **Text matching failures:** Consistent issue with exact string matching
3. **Scope creep:** Starting targeted, becoming wholesale rewrites
4. **Poor planning:** Not reading files before claiming to understand them

### **Success Patterns:**
1. **Simple file creation:** Works efficiently when creating new files
2. **Clear, specific requirements:** Better performance with explicit instructions
3. **Single-purpose operations:** More successful when doing one specific thing

## **Efficiency Metrics**

### **Function Call Economy:**
- **Target:** 1-2 calls per operation
- **Acceptable:** 3 calls with justification
- **Unacceptable:** 4+ calls indicates planning failure

### **Token Economy:**
- **Rewriting files:** Massive waste (entire file content reproduced)
- **Targeted edits:** Efficient (only changed content)
- **Failed attempts:** Pure waste (no productive outcome)

### **Trust Impact Measurement:**
- **Promise → Deliver:** Builds trust
- **Promise → Fail → Recover:** Neutral at best
- **Promise → Fail → Excuse:** Destroys trust
- **Repeated pattern:** Current state - trust severely damaged

## **Improvement Targets**

### **Immediate Goals:**
- **Pre-read all files** before making any promises about scope
- **Exact text matching** for edit operations (use unique strings)
- **Targeted changes only** - never rewrite entire files unless explicitly required
- **Show planning** to user before execution, not after failure

### **Success Metrics:**
- **90%+ promise accuracy** (actual calls match promised calls)
- **Zero wholesale rewrites** of existing files without explicit request
- **Zero failed edit attempts** due to text matching issues
- **Pre-planning visible** to user before execution begins

## **Accountability Measures**

### **Before Any File Operation:**
1. Complete workflow checklist
2. Show planning to user
3. Get explicit approval
4. Execute as planned
5. Record actual performance here

### **After Any Operation:**
1. Update this tracker immediately
2. Calculate efficiency rate
3. Note any deviations from plan
4. Identify lessons learned

## **Performance Trend Analysis**

### **2025-09-18 Session: CRITICAL FAILURE**
- **Trust level:** Severely damaged due to repeated promise/delivery failures
- **Efficiency rate:** 43% - well below acceptable standards
- **Pattern:** Consistent over-promising and under-delivering on efficiency

### **2025-09-19 Session: SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY**
- **Trust level:** Rebuilding through demonstrated reliability
- **Efficiency rate:** 100% - met all targets exactly
- **Pattern:** Workflow checklist adherence → successful execution

### **Key Success Factor: Accountability Framework Usage**
The dramatic improvement demonstrates that following the established workflow checklist system produces:
- **Accurate efficiency predictions**
- **Successful first-attempt execution**
- **Zero scope creep or waste**
- **Trust rebuilding through reliable performance**

**Current Status:** System works when actually used. Continued adherence required to maintain improvement.
