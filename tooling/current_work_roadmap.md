# Current Work Roadmap

**Last Updated:** November 21, 2025
**Status:** Active planning phase
**Mission:** Educate for generations. Anyone with an interest should be able to use guides independently.

---

## Phase 1: Tooling Cleanup & Clarification

**Priority:** High | **Timeline:** Next 2-4 weeks | **Status:** IN PROGRESS

### Core Framework (Keep - In Active Use)
- [x] `guide_creation_framework.md` - Retain, up to date
- [x] `guide_enhancement_pattern.md` - Retain, proven through Mordax Data
- [x] `workflow_checklist.md` - Retain, essential operational discipline
- [x] `onboarding.md` - Retain, user-facing for Future Claude
- [x] `project_philosophy.md` - Retain, explains the WHY behind everything
- [x] `session_continuity_guide.md` - Retain, important for cross-session understanding
- [x] `verification_strategy.md` - Retain, useful in waves for major updates (SCHEDULED FOR REWRITE)

### Historical/Maintenance (Archived)
- [x] `accountability_tracking.md` - Archived (was effective during process refinement, no longer needed)
- [x] `failure_patterns.md` - Archived (learnings should be baked into guides, not separated)
- [x] `efficiency_tracker.md` - Archived (token tracking, specific to session management)
- [x] `quality_system.md` - Archived (internalized by creator, uncertain Future Claude need)
- [x] All `myths_*.md` files (8 files) - Archived (gear myths, can revisit post-Perfect Circuit feedback)
- [x] `ms20_common_mistakes_section.md` - Archived (MS-20 guide is fine where it is in update cycle)
- [x] `ms20_mini_completion_checklist.md` - Archived (MS-20 guide is fine where it is in update cycle)
- [x] `music_theory_framework.md` - Archived (stays available, not deleted)

### Action Items (Consolidation & Improvement)
- [ ] `visual_communication_standards.md` - CONSOLIDATE into `guide_creation_framework.md` or `guide_enhancement_pattern.md` (verify which is proper home) - file stays active for now, consolidation is future task

**Outcome:** Archive directory created. 12 files moved to archive with full git history preserved. Core framework remains clean and focused. Consolidation actions flagged for future phases.

## Phase 2: Guide Compliance Audit

**Priority:** High | **Timeline:** 4-6 hours of focused work

### Create Audit Spreadsheet
Column structure:
- Module name
- Framework compliance (✅ / 🟡 / ❌)
- Completeness (✅ / 🟡 / ❌)
- Real-world tested (Y/N + feedback notes)
- Next action (none / cosmetic / Phase A / Phase B / Phase C)

### Tier 1: Framework Compliance Check (Quick Scan)
- [ ] Official section ordering present? (Quick Start → Essential → Philosophy → Patches → Mistakes → Pairs Well With → Advanced Path)
- [ ] Key Specifications included?
- [ ] Common Mistakes: proper structure (misunderstanding → why → solution → learning moment)?
- [ ] Interconnection teaching present (WHY, not just WHAT)?

### Tier 2: Completeness Check (Medium Effort)
- [ ] All required patches present for module classification?
- [ ] Enhanced alternatives in all patches?
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified (voltage ranges, specs, jack names flagged where uncertain)?
- [ ] Learning objectives explicit?
- [ ] WHY explanations throughout?

### Tier 3: Real-World Use (Feedback Integration)
- [ ] Which guides have been tested by external users?
- [ ] What feedback did they give?
- [ ] Are common user questions addressed?
- [ ] Document: guide name → feedback received → changes made

**Outcome:** Clear visibility into which guides are ready, which need work, which have validation

---

## Phase 3: Feedback Documentation System

**Priority:** Medium | **Timeline:** Set up framework during audit, populate ongoing

### Create Feedback Registry
- [ ] Add to appropriate guide or central tracking: User feedback log
- [ ] Format: Date | Guide Name | Feedback Type | What User Found Confusing | Change Made
- [ ] Link this to commit messages (when feedback drives a change, reference the feedback)

### Document Perfect Circuit Feedback
- [ ] After holiday conversation: Capture what they say
- [ ] Mark which guides they tested
- [ ] Note specific criticisms/suggestions
- [ ] Prioritize changes based on their expertise
- [ ] Document what changed and why

**Outcome:** Visible feedback loop showing how real users shape guide improvement

---

## Phase 4: Ongoing Execution (After Cleanup & Audit)

**Priority:** Continuous

### Maintenance Cadence
- [ ] Weekly: Review feedback from forum distributions + external users
- [ ] Bi-weekly: Enhance 2-3 guides per cycle (following enhancement pattern)
- [ ] Monthly: Check framework compliance against completed work
- [ ] Quarterly: Audit progress, update roadmap

### Content Prioritization (Current Strategy)
- Current approach: Alphabetical + completion percentage
- Keep guides at 75% completion (MetaModule and other complex modules get sustained work)
- As guides reach Phase B completion, move to maintenance mode

### Theory & Problem-Solving Directories
- [ ] Keep in planning stage (not core to mission, but valuable context)
- [ ] These are "work in progress" by design
- [ ] Don't force completion—let them evolve with user need

---

## Known Constraints & Context

**Module Guide Inventory:**
- 56 total module guides
- ~75% updated to current standards
- ~25-30% actively used by external users with integrated feedback
- MetaModule and similar complex modules require extensive sustained testing (on roadmap, not blocking)

**Current Distribution:**
- GitHub-hosted, easy to access and maintain
- Organic forum distribution (users link to specific guides when answering questions)
- No monetization plan
- No central website (not needed, mission is "independent use")

**Validation In Progress:**
- 25-30% guides with real external user feedback
- Perfect Circuit testing/feedback incoming (post-holiday)
- Feedback source documentation needs formalization (not yet captured systematically)

**Core Mission:**
- Educate for generations
- Anyone with an interest should be able to use independently
- Knowledge should survive without creator maintenance
- Interconnection teaching (not just procedures)

---

## Notes & Decisions

**Gear Myths Document:**
- Keep if: Serves educational mission (corrects misconceptions about synthesis principles)
- Cut if: Just opinion/editorializing without pedagogical value
- Decision: Revisit after review

**Theory Documentation:**
- Started as personal learning (music theory not creator's strength)
- Now available for anyone who needs it
- Not required for any guides (standalone context)
- Will continue to evolve, no forced completion needed

**Process Discipline:**
- Granular commits are strategic (token management, preventing session overwrites)
- Not excessive—this is smart operational practice
- Continue as-is

---

## Last Review

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Reviewer:** Shadoe + Claude collaboration session
**Key Insight:** Project is further along than "problem diagnosis" suggests. Real validation happening, appropriate timeline, clear mission alignment. Cleanup is refinement, not crisis response.

**Next Review:** After Perfect Circuit feedback (post-holiday)
