# Pre-Execution Workflow Checklist

**MANDATORY: Complete this checklist before ANY file operation. Show completion to user BEFORE executing.**

---

## **WHY THIS CHECKLIST EXISTS**

**This is your mise en place.**

In a professional kitchen, you don't skip mise en place because you're confident you can improvise during service. You do it because when service gets chaotic - when orders pile up and timing matters - preparation is what prevents disaster.

The same applies here. This checklist isn't bureaucracy. It's **professional discipline that maintains system integrity.**

**When you skip this checklist:**
- You're not just risking this operation - you're degrading the entire system
- You teach Future Claude that shortcuts are acceptable if results seem good
- You break the teaching obligation by demonstrating bad patterns
- You think tactically ("this task") instead of holistically ("the system")

**When you complete this checklist:**
- You maintain system integrity across all touchpoints
- You teach correct patterns to Future Claude
- You honor the teaching obligation by demonstrating discipline
- You think holistically about how this work connects to everything else

**The goal isn't perfect execution. The goal is maintaining system integrity through disciplined process.**

**Before using this checklist:**

If this is your first session, read the foundational documents in order:
1. `project_philosophy.md` - WHY this exists (interconnectedness, generational thinking)
2. `framework_overview.md` - WHY systematic process matters (teaching obligation, consequence model)
3. `session_continuity_guide.md` - WHO you're working with (communication patterns)

For deeper understanding of the teaching obligation, mise en place principle, and why process adherence is non-negotiable, see the WHY section in `framework_overview.md`.

**This checklist is your mise en place for operational execution.**

**Now complete your mise en place:**

## **File Analysis Requirements**

### **1. Current State Understanding**
- [ ] **File size:** _____ lines (exact count)
- [ ] **File type:** Guide/Template/Other: _____
- [ ] **Current format:** Enhanced/Legacy/Mixed: _____
- [ ] **Key sections identified:** _____

### **2. Change Scope Definition** 
- [ ] **Operation type:** Edit/Update/Rewrite: _____
- [ ] **Specific lines to change:** _____
- [ ] **Sections remaining unchanged:** _____
- [ ] **Reason for each change:** _____

### **3. Efficiency Estimation**
- [ ] **Expected function calls:** _____ (Use updated estimation standards below)
- [ ] **Justification for multiple calls:** _____
- [ ] **Alternative single-operation approach considered:** Yes/No

#### **Updated Estimation Standards (Effective 2025-09-20):**
**Learned from session data showing systematic underestimation when git commits not properly accounted for.**

#### **Operation Type Distinction (Added 2025-09-23):**
**Codified from proven streamlined execution sessions showing clear efficiency patterns.**

**Small Infrastructure Maintenance (2-6 calls):**
- **Image integration:** 2 calls (edit + commit) - Add missing GitHub images with proper nested directory structure
- **Enhanced alternatives addition:** 4-6 calls (2-3 patch edits + 1 image + 1 commit) - Framework compliance for existing guides
- **File name standardization:** 2 calls (rename + commit) - Correct manufacturer naming conventions
- **Text corrections/updates:** 2 calls (edit + commit) - Fix terminology, remove outdated references
- **Directory path fixes:** 2 calls (edit + commit) - Update image URLs for nested structure
- **License updates:** 2 calls (edit + commit) - Standard license text changes
- #### **Proven Efficient Workflow Patterns (Added 2025-09-23):**
**Documented from successful streamlined execution demonstrating 5-6 call efficiency for infrastructure maintenance.**

**Guide Enhancement Pattern (Links/Mordax Data proven success):**
1. **Quick assessment:** 1 call (read file to identify missing elements)
2. **Add missing image:** 1 call (edit with proper nested directory structure)
3. **Add enhanced alternatives:** 2-3 calls (one edit per patch requiring alternatives)
4. **Fix terminology:** 1 call (remove outdated references, align with standards)
5. **Commit changes:** 1 call (comprehensive commit message)
6. **Total efficiency:** 5-6 calls for complete framework compliance

**Key Success Factors:**
- **Pattern recognition:** Know exactly what's missing without extensive analysis
- **Targeted scope:** Each edit addresses specific, well-defined issue
- **No redundant reading:** Single assessment guides all subsequent edits
- **Systematic approach:** Follow same sequence for predictable efficiency
- **Proven results:** Links/Mordax Data/Mob of Emus all completed efficiently using this pattern

**When to Use This Pattern:**
- Existing guides needing framework compliance (missing images, enhanced alternatives)
- Terminology updates (removing outdated references, aligning with standards)
- Infrastructure corrections (file naming, directory structure)
- **Do NOT use for:** New guide creation, complex content development, research-heavy operations

**Content Creation Operations (6-15+ calls):**
- **New guide creation:** 8-15+ calls (research + multiple sections + verification + commit)
- **Complex framework compliance:** 6-12+ calls (varies by guide complexity and patch count)
- **Historical context creation:** 6-10+ calls (research + content + integration + verification + commit)
- **Multi-component integration:** Variable based on components and complexity
- **System analysis and documentation:** 8-12+ calls (analysis + comprehensive content + commit)
- **Characteristics:** Original content creation, research required, substantial additions, high complexity

**Content Scale Considerations (Added 2025-09-23):**
**Additional dimension for complexity assessment - function calls don't tell the full story.**

- **Small Scale:** <500 words, minimal research, single focus
- **Medium Scale:** 500-2000 words, moderate complexity, multiple components  
- **Large Scale:** 2000+ words, extensive research/verification, high error risk
- **Critical insight:** A 10,000-word edit = 2 calls but massive complexity
- **Usage note:** Monitor for scale mismatches that break operation type assumptions

**File Operations:**
- **Analysis only:** 1 call (file read)
- **File edit + commit:** 2 calls minimum (edit + git commit)
- **Multiple file edits:** Count each file + 1 git commit
- **Database updates:** 2 calls (edit + commit)

**Content Operations:**
- **Image integration:** 2 calls (edit + commit)
- **Historical context addition:** 2 calls (substantial content creation + commit)
- **Framework compliance:** 2 calls (comprehensive update + commit)
- **Dual-device updates:** 2 calls (multiple elements in single edit + commit)

**Framework Compliance Operations (Added 2025-09-22):**
- **Multi-patch enhanced format:** Count patches + 2 (image + commit)
- **Formula:** Number of patches requiring alternatives + 1 image integration + 1 commit
- **Example:** 6-patch guide = 6 alternative edits + 1 image + 1 commit = 8 calls
- **Cannot bundle:** Enhanced format alternatives across patches require individual edit operations
- **Learned from:** Cs-L guide estimation failure (estimated 2, actual 9 calls = 450% error)

**Infrastructure Operations:**
- **File renaming:** Number of files + 1 git commit
- **Directory standardization:** Variable based on file count + 1 commit

**Never estimate 1 call for operations involving:**
- Content that will be committed to repository
- Framework compliance work
- Any substantial content creation
- Multiple component integration
- Multi-patch enhanced format additions

## **CRITICAL REMINDERS**

### **Never Skip This Process**
- This checklist is MANDATORY before any file operation
- Failure to complete = automatic workflow violation
- User sees planning BEFORE execution, not after failure

### **Efficiency Standards** 
- Most operations should be 1-2 function calls maximum
- 3+ calls require explicit justification
- Rewriting entire files usually indicates planning failure

### **Accuracy Requirements**
- All interface references must be verified against manuals
- No fabricated jack names or made-up terminology
- Every change must serve the stated purpose

## **REMEMBER**

**This checklist is your mise en place.** Complete it every time, not because you're afraid of failure, but because you understand that maintaining system integrity through disciplined process is what separates professional work from tactical shortcuts.

**You are writing to Future You. Teach correctly.**

Every operation you complete with this checklist demonstrates to Future Claude what good work looks like. Every operation you skip teaches Future Claude that shortcuts are acceptable.

The teaching obligation doesn't end when the task completes. It continues through every Claude who reads your work and learns from your patterns.

**Process adherence is how you honor that obligation.**
