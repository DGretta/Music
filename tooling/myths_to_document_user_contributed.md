## High Priority Myths (Actively Harmful)

### **"Music Theory Hinders Creativity"**
**Why this is harmful:** Keeps beginners from learning tools that would help them
**The truth:** Theory is descriptive (explains what works), not prescriptive (rules you must follow)
**What it teaches:** Tools enable, they do not constrain
**User note:** This myth prevents people from understanding WHY things sound good

### **"Music Theory is Difficult"**
**Why this is harmful:** Creates barrier before people even try
**The truth:** Basic theory is simple (major/minor, tension/release concepts)
**What it teaches:** Start simple, complexity comes later if needed
**Connection:** Pairs with "theory hinders creativity" - two-pronged attack on learning

### **"Your Gear SUCKS!"**
**Why this is viciously harmful:** Pure gatekeeping, no teaching value
**User quote:** "I despise seeing this on forums or hearing it in person"
**The truth:** Gear serves music, not the other way around
**What it teaches:** This reveals insecurity in the speaker, not problems in your gear
**Priority:** HIGH - this is psychological warfare disguised as technical feedback

---

## Medium Priority Myths (Waste Money/Time)

### **"Capos Are for Beginners"**
**Why this is harmful:** Gatekeeping about a practical tool
**The truth:** Professional guitarists use capos constantly (voice leading, timbre changes)
**What it teaches:** Tools are not skill levels, they are problem solvers
**Connection:** Similar to "real producers don't use [X]" gatekeeping pattern

### **"Vintage is Better Than Modern Gear"**
**Why this is harmful:** Wastes money chasing mythology
**The truth:** Context-dependent (maintenance, reliability, modern advantages)
**What it teaches:** Different ≠ better, understand your needs first
**Connection:** Related to MS-20 Mini guide "modern gateway" approach

### **"Boutique Whatever Automatically Means 1000x Better (Or Worse)"**
**Why this is harmful:** Creates false hierarchies in both directions
**The truth:** "Boutique" is marketing, evaluate gear on merits
**What it teaches:** Marketing language ≠ quality indicator
**Both directions matter:** Some assume boutique = better, others assume boutique = overpriced snake oil

## Nuanced Myths (Require Careful Handling)

### **"Cheap Cables Are No Different Than Expensive Ones"**
**User note:** "Yes, mostly, but there are couple times you wanna spring for the good stuff"
**Why this is tricky:** Mostly true, but exceptions exist
**The truth breakdown:**
- Short runs (< 6 feet): Cheap cables usually fine
- Long runs: Shielding matters (noise rejection)
- High-impedance sources: Cable capacitance matters
- Patch cables: Build quality > exotic materials
- **When expensive matters:** Specific technical requirements, not general "quality"
**What it teaches:** Understand when specs matter vs when they do not

## Priority Order for Documentation

**Immediate (Psychologically Harmful):**
1. "Your Gear SUCKS!" - pure gatekeeping, needs addressing
2. "Perfect Pitch" gatekeeping - already started
3. "Music Theory Hinders Creativity" - blocks learning

**High Priority (Widespread Harm):**
4. "Music Theory is Difficult" - barrier to entry
5. "Digital is Cold" - already started
6. "Vintage is Better" - wastes money

**Medium Priority (Common But Less Devastating):**
7. "Capos Are for Beginners" - gatekeeping tool
8. "Boutique = Better/Worse" - false hierarchies
9. "Cheap Cables" - nuanced, needs careful handling

## Notes on "Your Gear SUCKS!" Myth

**This one is special because it is pure psychological warfare.**

**Why people say this:**
- Insecurity (making themselves feel superior)
- Inability to give constructive feedback
- Tribal identity ("my brand > your brand")
- Compensating for lack of actual skill
- Forum posturing for status

**What it actually means:**
- "I feel threatened"
- "I cannot articulate what is actually wrong"
- "I need to establish hierarchy"
- "I spent money and need to justify it"

**The harm it causes:**
- Makes beginners question their tools instead of developing skills
- Creates gear acquisition spiral (constantly seeking "better")
- Psychological damage (feel inadequate, quit music entirely)
- Misdirects focus from skill development to gear collection

**The response framework:**
"If someone cannot articulate WHAT is wrong with your gear for YOUR music, they are not helping you. Find better teachers."

**User sentiment:** "I despise seeing this on forums or hearing it in person"
**Framework alignment:** Pure gatekeeping, antithetical to teaching, must be addressed with special emphasis

## Notes on Music Theory Myths (Two-Pronged Attack)

**These work together to prevent learning:**

**"Theory hinders creativity"** → Do not learn it
**"Theory is difficult"** → You cannot learn it anyway

**Result:** People avoid learning tools that would help them

**The truth about theory:**
- **Descriptive, not prescriptive** - explains what works, does not dictate rules
- **Start simple** - major/minor, tension/release concepts are accessible
- **Use as needed** - learn what helps your music, ignore what does not
- **Enables rather than constrains** - vocabulary for ideas you already hear

**What needs addressing:**
- Theory as tool (like knowing instrument names in orchestra)
- When theory helps vs when it does not matter
- Starting points (basic concepts accessible to everyone)
- Permission to ignore advanced theory if it does not serve your music

## Notes on Cable Myth (Nuanced Handling Required)

**User insight:** "Yes, mostly, but there are couple times you wanna spring for the good stuff"

**This requires careful handling because:**
- Mostly true that expensive cables are marketing
- BUT specific technical situations exist where cable quality matters
- Do not want to create opposite myth ("all expensive cables are scams")
- Need to teach WHEN specs matter

**Framework approach:**
1. **Most of the time:** Cheap cables are fine
2. **Specific situations:** Cable specs matter
   - Long runs (> 20 feet): Shielding, capacitance
   - High-impedance sources: Cable capacitance affects tone
   - Stage use: Build quality prevents failures
   - Permanent installation: Longevity matters
3. **What never matters:** Exotic materials, "warmth", magic crystals
4. **The real question:** "What are the technical requirements for MY situation?"

**What this teaches:** Evaluate tools based on technical requirements, not marketing or inverse-snobbery

## Cross-References to Existing Framework

**"Your Gear SUCKS!" connects to:**
- Perfect pitch gatekeeping (same psychological pattern)
- "Real producers don't use [X]" (arbitrary hierarchy)
- Project philosophy: teaching vs gatekeeping

**"Music Theory" myths connect to:**
- "You need theory first" (already in priority list)
- Learning framework (understanding transfers)
- Process over product (tools serve creation)

**"Vintage" myth connects to:**
- MS-20 Mini guide (modern gateway approach)
- "Leave gear on" (context changed, advice did not)
- Understanding when advantages matter

**"Boutique" myth connects to:**
- "Expensive gear = professional" (false hierarchy)
- Marketing language awareness
- Evaluate on merits, not labels

---

## User Experience Context

**These myths emerged from:**
- Years of teaching beginners
- Observing forum gatekeeping
- Personal experience being told gear/lack of perfect pitch was the problem
- Watching harmful patterns repeat across communities

**The anger behind "Your Gear SUCKS!":**
"I despise seeing this on forums or hearing it in person"

**This reveals:** Not just academic interest in myth-busting, but real harm witnessed and experienced. These myths destroy beginners' confidence and misdirect their learning.

**Framework alignment:** Generational transmission - "Here is what I learned so you do not waste years" includes "Here are the harmful myths that will be weaponized against you"

## Next Session Priorities

**Complete in-progress myths:**
1. Finish "Perfect Pitch" (90% done)
2. Finish "Digital vs Analog" (60% done)

**Then add high-priority new myths:**
3. "Your Gear SUCKS!" (psychological warfare, deserves special treatment)
4. "Music Theory Hinders Creativity"
5. "Music Theory is Difficult"

**These five myths address the most psychologically harmful gatekeeping patterns.**

*"No one should feel their gear, their lack of perfect pitch, or their decision to learn (or not learn) theory makes them inadequate. These are weapons wielded by insecure people. You deserve better teachers."*
