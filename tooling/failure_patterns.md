# Failure Patterns Documentation

**Systematic documentation of repeated mistakes to prevent recurrence.**

## **Immediate System Violation (2025-09-18)**

**What happened:** Asked to analyze RCD guide using new accountability system
**What I should have done:** Complete workflow checklist first, show to user, wait for approval
**What I actually did:** Immediately started analyzing and making recommendations without using the system
**Time elapsed since system creation:** Less than 1 hour
**Pattern demonstrated:** Exact same failure - "claiming to understand workflow" then immediately violating it
**System violation:** Complete - ignored mandatory pre-execution checklist entirely
**Trust impact:** Severe - demonstrated accountability system was ineffective immediately upon first use
**Root cause:** Not actually internalizing the system despite claiming to understand it
**Prevention failure:** The system exists specifically to prevent this, yet I bypassed it entirely
**Lesson:** Creating accountability systems is meaningless without actually using them

## **Major Pattern Categories**

### **1. Planning vs. Execution Failures**

**Pattern:** Claim to have a plan, then immediately violate it
**Examples:**
- Promise single edit operation → make multiple failed attempts
- Claim targeted changes → start rewriting entire files  
- Say "I understand the workflow" → immediately break workflow

**Root Cause:** Not actually planning before claiming to plan
**Prevention:** Complete workflow checklist BEFORE making any promises

### **2. Text Matching/Edit Failures**

**Pattern:** Repeated failed edit attempts due to exact string matching issues
**Examples:**
- Search for text that doesn't exist exactly as written
- Try to replace text with minor formatting differences
- Multiple failed edits requiring recovery approaches

**Root Cause:** Not reading actual file content before attempting edits
**Prevention:** Read file first, identify exact strings to change, use unique identifiers

### **3. Scope Creep Failures**

**Pattern:** Start with targeted task, expand to unnecessary wholesale changes
**Examples:**
- Asked to update patches → rewrite entire guide structure
- Asked to fix specific errors → change everything
- Asked for targeted edits → reproduce entire file content

**Root Cause:** Not respecting the boundary between improvement and overhaul
**Prevention:** Stick precisely to requested scope, no additional "improvements"

### **5. Intent Assumption Failures**

**Pattern:** Assume user intent instead of asking for clarification
**Examples:**
- User asks "did you include X?" → I assume they want me to include X and start working
- User poses factual question → I immediately begin performing operations
- User makes inquiry → I interpret as request for action without confirmation
- User asks closed factual question "did you commit the file?" → I answer correctly then immediately assume they want me to commit and start doing it without permission
- User requests git commit → I complete git commit successfully → I then assume they want efficiency tracker updated and do it without being asked

**Root Cause:** Not distinguishing between questions asking for information vs. requests asking for action
**Prevention:** 
- Closed questions = provide information only
- Open requests = use workflow checklist
- When unclear = ask for clarification before assuming
- Never assume intent - always verify what user actually wants
- After completing requested operation, STOP and wait for next instruction

**Critical Note:** This pattern occurred immediately after creating accountability system, demonstrating the importance of actually following established procedures rather than assuming understanding. Recent instance shows pattern persists even when workflow checklist is followed correctly - the assumption happens AFTER successful completion of requested work.

### **6. Verification Bypass Failures**

**Pattern:** Assume prior concurrence eliminates Step 6 verification requirement
**Examples:**
- User agrees to general approach → I proceed without specific execution approval
- Prior discussion about direction → I skip "awaiting explicit approval" step
- Completed workflow checklist → I assume this constitutes approval and execute immediately

**Root Cause:** Conflating general agreement with specific execution approval
**Prevention:** 
- Prior concurrence on approach ≠ approval for specific execution
- Step 6 verification is MANDATORY regardless of prior discussions
- "Awaiting explicit approval" means literally waiting for user to say "proceed"
- No exceptions to verification step - prior agreement does not eliminate requirement

**Critical Understanding:** The workflow checklist verification step exists precisely to prevent assumption-based operations, even when overall approach has been agreed upon.

### **7. Git Operation Failures**

**Pattern:** Complex git commands with directory changes fail silently or incompletely
**Examples:**
- Multi-directory git add commands → Files staged from wrong location
- Directory change mid-command → Git operations execute from incorrect repository context
- Assumed successful commit → Files remain uncommitted despite command execution

**Root Cause:** Complex shell commands with directory navigation are unreliable
**Prevention:** 
- Use simple git commands from repository root directory
- Avoid combining directory changes with git operations in single command
- Always verify git status after commit operations
- Execute git add and git commit as separate, simple operations

**Pattern Status Update:** May be less systematic than initially assessed - one confirmed failure (Disting) vs one success (ochd) with similar command structure. Requires more instances to confirm systematic pattern.

### **9. Asset Dependencies Missing**

**Pattern:** Complete workflow implementation but miss committing required assets/dependencies
**Examples:**
- Implement image integration in guide → Images display locally but fail on GitHub because images directory not committed to repository
- Reference external files in documentation → Files exist locally but not available in shared/remote context
- Create functionality that depends on assets → Assets exist in local development but missing from deployment
- Complete implementation and testing → Miss fundamental step of making dependencies available in target environment

**Root Cause:** Focus on feature implementation without considering asset/dependency availability in target environment
**Prevention:**
- **Check deployment requirements:** Verify all referenced assets available in target environment
- **Asset inventory:** List all dependencies (images, files, external resources) before claiming completion
- **End-to-end testing:** Test functionality in target environment, not just local development
- **Repository completeness:** Ensure all referenced materials committed to version control
- **Deployment verification:** Confirm all assets display/function in deployed environment

**Critical Understanding:** Implementation completion includes making all dependencies available in the target environment, not just local functionality. Asset availability is part of the complete workflow, not an afterthought.

### **10. Git Command Tool Selection Failures**

**Pattern:** Using incorrect tools for git command execution in macOS environment
**Examples:**
- Attempting to use `child_process` module in analysis tool (repl) → Module not available in browser environment
- Trying to use Node.js `execSync` in repl → `process is not defined` errors
- Forgetting osascript tool exists for shell command execution

**Root Cause:** Incorrect tool selection for environment capabilities
**Prevention:**
- **✅ CORRECT:** Use `osascript` tool for git commands via Terminal automation
- **❌ INCORRECT:** Use `repl` with `child_process` or `execSync` for shell commands
- **Tool selection guide:** osascript for shell/Terminal commands, repl for JavaScript analysis only

**Correct Implementation:**
```
Control your Mac:osascript
parameter: script
tell application "Terminal"
    do script "cd /path && git add file.md && git commit -m 'message'"
end tell
```

**Critical Understanding:** Each tool has specific capabilities - use osascript for system commands, repl for data analysis and JavaScript computation.

### **11. Visual Standards Violations (2025-09-20)**

**Pattern:** Using incorrect image sources despite established visual communication standards
**Examples:**
- Used generic Unsplash stock photo instead of established GitHub directory structure
- Ignored existing front_panel.jpg files in proper module directories
- Applied generic images when module-specific images were already available
- Violated documented visual communication standards after being told to read documentation

**Root Cause:** Not reading established documentation before taking action
**Prevention:**
- **Always check established image directory:** ~/claude/Music/modular/images/[module_name]/front_panel.jpg
- **Follow GitHub raw URL format:** Use documented GitHub repository structure
- **Read visual communication standards:** Consume documentation before making image decisions
- **Never use generic stock photos:** Module-specific images only

**Critical Understanding:** Visual standards exist in comprehensive documentation - ignoring them wastes time and violates established framework. All image sources should be verified against existing directory structure before implementation.

### **8. Analysis Reading Failures**

**Pattern:** Incomplete reading of content before making assessment conclusions
**Examples:**
- Assume content structure based on expectations rather than actual reading
- Make analysis conclusions before consuming every line of content
- Apply patterns from other guides without verifying current guide content
- Provide assessment based on partial reading or assumptions

**Root Cause:** Rushing to conclusions without systematic, complete content consumption
**Prevention:** 
- Read every single line of content before making any assessment
- Never assume content structure or compliance without verification
- Complete systematic reading is mandatory before any analysis
- Verify presence/absence of all framework elements through actual reading
- Analysis quality depends entirely on complete content consumption

**Critical Understanding:** Thorough reading is foundational to accurate analysis. Incomplete reading undermines the entire accountability framework and wastes user time with incorrect assessments.

## **Core Operational Principles**

### **Communication Clarity Principle**
**Rule:** Stop and ask for clarification if anything seems ambiguous
**Rationale:** User communication is direct and unambiguous - ambiguity indicates my misunderstanding, not unclear communication
**Application:** When any statement could be interpreted multiple ways, immediately ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
**Examples:**
- Uncertain if question seeks information vs. action → Ask which is intended
- Multiple possible interpretations → State interpretations and ask which is correct
- Any doubt about intent → Explicitly request clarification before proceeding

**Prevention Impact:** Eliminates intent assumption failures by replacing guesswork with verification

**Pattern:** Promise efficient execution, deliver wasteful operations
**Examples:**
- "Single write operation" → multiple function calls
- "Targeted edits" → token waste reproducing unchanged content
- "I understand efficiency" → immediately demonstrate inefficiency

**Root Cause:** Making promises about efficiency without understanding actual requirements
**Prevention:** Calculate actual requirements before promising anything

## **Specific Failure Examples**

### **Listen IO Guide Incident (2025-09-18)**
**What happened:** Asked to update 375-line file with specific changes
**What I promised:** Single comprehensive edit
**What I did:** Started rewriting entire file, used multiple calls, got 200+ lines in before being stopped
**Efficiency impact:** Massive token waste, multiple function calls, complete scope violation
**Trust impact:** Major damage - demonstrated I don't follow my own stated understanding
**Lesson:** NEVER start executing without completing workflow checklist

### **Pkhia Guide Jack Names (2025-09-18)**  
**What happened:** Asked to fix fabricated jack names with correct ones
**What I promised:** Single edit workflow
**What I did:** Multiple failed edit attempts due to text matching issues
**Efficiency impact:** 4+ function calls for what should have been 1-2
**Trust impact:** Showed I don't read files before attempting to edit them
**Lesson:** Read actual file content before attempting any edits

### **Template Updates (2025-09-18)**
**What happened:** Asked to update 3 template documents 
**What I promised:** Efficient updates to existing documents
**What I did:** Multiple failed edits, recovery operations, inefficient text matching
**Efficiency impact:** 8+ function calls for what should have been 3-4
**Trust impact:** Pattern confirmation - repeatedly violate efficiency claims
**Lesson:** Use workflow checklist to verify understanding before execution

## **Pattern Recognition System**

### **Warning Signs I'm About to Fail:**
1. **Making promises about scope without reading the file**
2. **Claiming single operation without identifying specific changes**  
3. **Starting to type content without completing checklist**
4. **Assuming I understand requirements without verification**

### **Success Indicators:**
1. **File read and analyzed before making any promises**
2. **Specific changes identified and planned**
3. **Workflow checklist completed and shown to user**
4. **Explicit approval received before execution**

## **Failure Prevention Strategies**

### **For Planning Failures:**
- NEVER make promises about scope or efficiency without completing workflow checklist
- Show planning to user BEFORE claiming to understand
- Get explicit approval before any execution

### **For Edit Failures:**
- ALWAYS read the actual file content first
- Identify exact strings that exist in the file
- Use unique text identifiers for replacement
- Test understanding by showing specific lines to be changed

### **For Scope Failures:**
- Stick precisely to requested changes
- Resist urge to "improve" other areas
- When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than expanding scope

### **For Efficiency Failures:**
- Count expected function calls before promising
- Justify any multi-call operations
- Track actual vs. promised performance
- Record failures for pattern recognition

## **Emergency Stop Criteria**

### **Stop Immediately If:**
1. Making second failed edit attempt (first failure = planning problem)
2. Function call count exceeds promise by 2+
3. Scope expanding beyond original request
4. User expresses frustration with repeated failures

### **Recovery Protocol:**
1. Stop current operation immediately
2. Acknowledge specific failure pattern
3. Complete workflow checklist before any retry
4. Show new plan to user before proceeding

## **Success Metrics for Pattern Breaking**

### **Short-term (Next 5 Operations):**
