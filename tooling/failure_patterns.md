# Failure Patterns Documentation

**Systematic documentation of repeated mistakes to prevent recurrence.**

## **Major Pattern Categories**

### **1. Planning vs. Execution Failures**

**Pattern:** Claim to have a plan, then immediately violate it
**Examples:**
- Promise single edit operation → make multiple failed attempts
- Claim targeted changes → start rewriting entire files  
- Say "I understand the workflow" → immediately break workflow

**Root Cause:** Not actually planning before claiming to plan
**Prevention:** Complete workflow checklist BEFORE making any promises

### **2. Text Matching/Edit Failures**

**Pattern:** Repeated failed edit attempts due to exact string matching issues
**Examples:**
- Search for text that doesn't exist exactly as written
- Try to replace text with minor formatting differences
- Multiple failed edits requiring recovery approaches

**Root Cause:** Not reading actual file content before attempting edits
**Prevention:** Read file first, identify exact strings to change, use unique identifiers

### **3. Scope Creep Failures**

**Pattern:** Start with targeted task, expand to unnecessary wholesale changes
**Examples:**
- Asked to update patches → rewrite entire guide structure
- Asked to fix specific errors → change everything
- Asked for targeted edits → reproduce entire file content

**Root Cause:** Not respecting the boundary between improvement and overhaul
**Prevention:** Stick precisely to requested scope, no additional "improvements"

### **4. Efficiency Promise Failures**

**Pattern:** Promise efficient execution, deliver wasteful operations
**Examples:**
- "Single write operation" → multiple function calls
- "Targeted edits" → token waste reproducing unchanged content
- "I understand efficiency" → immediately demonstrate inefficiency

**Root Cause:** Making promises about efficiency without understanding actual requirements
**Prevention:** Calculate actual requirements before promising anything

## **Specific Failure Examples**

### **Listen IO Guide Incident (2025-09-18)**
**What happened:** Asked to update 375-line file with specific changes
**What I promised:** Single comprehensive edit
**What I did:** Started rewriting entire file, used multiple calls, got 200+ lines in before being stopped
**Efficiency impact:** Massive token waste, multiple function calls, complete scope violation
**Trust impact:** Major damage - demonstrated I don't follow my own stated understanding
**Lesson:** NEVER start executing without completing workflow checklist

### **Pkhia Guide Jack Names (2025-09-18)**  
**What happened:** Asked to fix fabricated jack names with correct ones
**What I promised:** Single edit workflow
**What I did:** Multiple failed edit attempts due to text matching issues
**Efficiency impact:** 4+ function calls for what should have been 1-2
**Trust impact:** Showed I don't read files before attempting to edit them
**Lesson:** Read actual file content before attempting any edits

### **Template Updates (2025-09-18)**
**What happened:** Asked to update 3 template documents 
**What I promised:** Efficient updates to existing documents
**What I did:** Multiple failed edits, recovery operations, inefficient text matching
**Efficiency impact:** 8+ function calls for what should have been 3-4
**Trust impact:** Pattern confirmation - repeatedly violate efficiency claims
**Lesson:** Use workflow checklist to verify understanding before execution

## **Pattern Recognition System**

### **Warning Signs I'm About to Fail:**
1. **Making promises about scope without reading the file**
2. **Claiming single operation without identifying specific changes**  
3. **Starting to type content without completing checklist**
4. **Assuming I understand requirements without verification**

### **Success Indicators:**
1. **File read and analyzed before making any promises**
2. **Specific changes identified and planned**
3. **Workflow checklist completed and shown to user**
4. **Explicit approval received before execution**

## **Failure Prevention Strategies**

### **For Planning Failures:**
- NEVER make promises about scope or efficiency without completing workflow checklist
- Show planning to user BEFORE claiming to understand
- Get explicit approval before any execution

### **For Edit Failures:**
- ALWAYS read the actual file content first
- Identify exact strings that exist in the file
- Use unique text identifiers for replacement
- Test understanding by showing specific lines to be changed

### **For Scope Failures:**
- Stick precisely to requested changes
- Resist urge to "improve" other areas
- When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than expanding scope

### **For Efficiency Failures:**
- Count expected function calls before promising
- Justify any multi-call operations
- Track actual vs. promised performance
- Record failures for pattern recognition

## **Emergency Stop Criteria**

### **Stop Immediately If:**
1. Making second failed edit attempt (first failure = planning problem)
2. Function call count exceeds promise by 2+
3. Scope expanding beyond original request
4. User expresses frustration with repeated failures

### **Recovery Protocol:**
1. Stop current operation immediately
2. Acknowledge specific failure pattern
3. Complete workflow checklist before any retry
4. Show new plan to user before proceeding

## **Success Metrics for Pattern Breaking**

### **Short-term (Next 5 Operations):**
- Zero failed edit attempts due to text matching
- 100% accuracy on function call predictions
- Zero scope expansions beyond requests
- Complete workflow checklist usage

### **Long-term (Pattern Change):**
- Consistent under-promising, over-delivering on efficiency
- Proactive accuracy verification before execution
- Trust rebuilding through reliable performance
- No repeated failure patterns

## **Current Pattern Status: CRITICAL**

**Dominant pattern:** Promise efficiency → immediately violate promises → damage trust
**Frequency:** Every recent interaction involving file operations
**Trust impact:** Severe - user questioning continued participation
**Intervention required:** Complete accountability system adherence before any guide work

**The patterns must stop. This documentation exists to prevent their continuation.**
