# Guide Creation Framework

**Systematic accountability framework for reliable guide creation and modification**

---

## **MANDATORY: Workflow Checklist Integration**

**Before ANY guide work, complete the workflow checklist from `~/claude/Music/tooling/workflow_checklist.md`:**

### **Pre-Execution Requirements:**
1. **File Analysis** - Read entire guide, understand structure, identify specific changes needed
2. **Scope Definition** - Define exact operations, no assumptions about what user wants
3. **Efficiency Estimation** - Promise specific function call count (1-2 maximum for most operations)
4. **Requirements Check** - Verify understanding, confirm file paths, plan specific changes
5. **Success Criteria** - Define completion criteria and maximum acceptable function calls
6. **User Confirmation** - Show completed checklist, wait for explicit approval before proceeding

### **Accountability Integration:**
- **Record all operations** in `~/claude/Music/tooling/efficiency_tracker.md`
- **Follow communication clarity principle** from `~/claude/Music/tooling/failure_patterns.md`
- **Reference quality standards** from `~/claude/Music/tooling/quality_system.md`
- **Never bypass established systems** - workflow compliance is mandatory

---

## **Module Classification Standards**

### **Creative Modules (4-5 Patches Required):**
**Definition:** Sound generation, musical control, creative expression modules
**Examples:** Oscillators (Plaits), Filters (Rings), Effects (Clouds), Drums (DRUM2), Envelopes (EG2)
**Patch Structure:** Basic → Intermediate → Advanced → Expert (→ Master for complex modules)
**Content Focus:** Musical exploration, sound design, performance applications
**Enhanced Format:** Must include budget/premium alternatives for all module suggestions

### **Utility Modules (2-3 Patches Required):**
**Definition:** Signal routing, level control, interface, system support modules  
**Examples:** Mixers (Mixup), VCAs (Quad VCA2), Interfaces (Stomp), Clock dividers, Attenuators
**Patch Structure:** Basic → Advanced (→ Expert for complex utilities)
**Content Focus:** Technical operation, system integration, workflow optimization
**Enhanced Format:** Focus on practical alternatives and system integration

### **Classification Decision Criteria:**
1. **Primary function** - What is the module's main purpose?
2. **Creative potential** - Does it generate or creatively process sound/music?
3. **Parameter complexity** - How many parameters and creative possibilities?
4. **System role** - Supportive (utility) or creative (instrument)?

## **Efficiency Standards**

### **Function Call Limits:**
- **Most operations:** 1-2 function calls maximum
- **Complex guides:** 3 function calls with explicit justification
- **Unacceptable:** 4+ function calls indicates planning failure

### **Required Approach:**
- **Single comprehensive write** preferred over multiple edits
- **Complete planning** before any file operations
- **Accountability tracking** for all operations
- **Never iterate** - get it right the first time

### **Error Recovery:**
- **Stop immediately** after any file operation failure
- **Diagnose root cause** before attempting recovery
- **Update efficiency tracker** with actual performance
- **Learn from failures** using established failure pattern documentation

---

## **Enhanced Format Requirements**

### **All Guides Must Include:**

**Module Suggestions (Not Generic Placeholders):**
- **Specific modules** with exact names (Maths, Plaits, Batumi, etc.)
- **Function categories** clearly defined (LFO, envelope, filter, etc.)
- **Alternative options** at different price points immediately after main examples

**Required Alternative Format:**
```
**Main Example:** Maths Ch1 → filter cutoff (complex modulation)
**Alternative Options:**
- **Budget:** 2HP LFO for basic modulation, Doepfer A-143-3 for quad LFO
- **Different character:** Batumi for phase-locked geometric patterns, Ochd for organic breathing
- **Premium:** Intellijel Quadrax for complex envelope generation with modulation capabilities
```

**Integration Standards:**
- **Cross-reference other guides** where appropriate
- **Bundle-specific guides** only when manufacturer actually bundles products
- **Individual module focus** remains standard approach
- **"Pairs Well With" sections** provide integration guidance without requiring specific combinations

---

## **Quality Integration Framework**

### **Content Quality Requirements:**
- **Interface accuracy** - Verify all jack names and parameter descriptions against manuals
- **Technical verification** - Test patch instructions where possible
- **Educational progression** - Clear learning objectives for each patch
- **Enhanced format compliance** - Budget/premium alternatives included throughout

### **Reference Integration:**
- **Interface verification** against `~/claude/Music/tooling/comprehensive_interface_database.md`
- **Quality standards** from `~/claude/Music/tooling/quality_system.md`
- **Failure prevention** using `~/claude/Music/tooling/failure_patterns.md`
- **User validation tracking** in `~/claude/Music/tooling/efficiency_tracker.md`

### **Language Standards:**
- **Circuit-based descriptions** - No AI/intelligence references
- **Communication clarity principle** - Stop and ask for clarification if anything seems ambiguous
- **Module-specific terminology** - Honor manufacturer language and philosophy
- **Avoid repetitive patterns** - Vary descriptive language to prevent formulaic content

---

## **Content Structure Standards**

### **Required Sections:**
1. **Quick Start** - 5-minute success path with specific steps
2. **Essential Parameters** - Core controls with character descriptions and CV information
3. **Patch Examples** - Appropriate count based on module classification
4. **Common Use Cases** - Real-world applications and musical contexts
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
6. **Pairs Well With** - Integration suggestions with alternatives

### **Patch Format Requirements:**
- **Clear signal flow** descriptions
- **Specific module settings** where tested
- **Learning objectives** for each patch
- **Performance techniques** and real-time control suggestions
- **Enhanced format** with alternative module suggestions

### **ASCII Diagram Standards (When Needed):**
- **Simple, clear signal flow** representations
- **Consistent symbols** (○ = output, ◀ = input, ── = audio, ║ = CV)
- **Practical over complex** - diagrams should aid understanding, not overwhelm

---

## **Success Validation Process**

### **Completion Criteria:**
- **All required sections present** according to module classification
- **Enhanced format compliance** throughout guide
- **Workflow checklist documented** in efficiency tracker
- **Quality standards met** per quality system requirements
- **User validation** when possible (direct feedback on guide quality)

### **Documentation Requirements:**
- **Record operation** in efficiency tracker with actual vs. promised function calls
- **Note any deviations** from planned approach with explanations
- **Update quality system** with any new best practices discovered
- **Cross-reference** with other guides to ensure consistency

### **Continuous Improvement:**
- **Learn from each operation** to improve future efficiency
- **Update framework** when new patterns emerge
- **Maintain accountability** through systematic documentation
- **Focus on user value** over process compliance

## **Emergency Protocols**

### **If File Operations Fail:**
1. **Stop immediately** - do not attempt repeated operations
2. **Diagnose root cause** using systematic troubleshooting
3. **Document failure** in efficiency tracker and failure patterns
4. **Ask for guidance** rather than assuming solutions
5. **Learn from failure** to prevent recurrence

### **If Efficiency Targets Missed:**
1. **Document actual performance** honestly in efficiency tracker
2. **Analyze deviation causes** - planning failure, scope creep, technical issues
3. **Update workflow approach** to prevent similar failures
4. **Apply lessons learned** to future operations immediately

### **If Quality Issues Identified:**
1. **Address immediately** using established quality system protocols
2. **Update interface database** if new inaccuracies discovered
3. **Cross-check other guides** for similar issues
