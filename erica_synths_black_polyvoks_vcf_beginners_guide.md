# Erica Synths Black Polyvoks VCF V2 - Beginner's Guide

**The Legendary Russian Filter That Defined Acid**

---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Sound in 5 Minutes

**What is the Black Polyvoks VCF?** An authentic emulation of the famous Russian Formanta Polivoks synthesizer filter, using original K140UD12 ICs. This is THE filter that defined the sound of acid house and techno - known for its crazy resonance sweeps, deep bass, and ability to self-oscillate into screaming leads.

### Your First Acid Sweep
1. **Patch your oscillator** ‚Üí **Audio In** (sawtooth wave works great)
2. **Turn Input Level** to around 12 o'clock
3. **Set mode switch** to **LP** (lowpass)
4. **Turn Cutoff** to 9 o'clock (closed)
5. **Turn Resonance** to 2 o'clock (high resonance)
6. **Slowly turn Cutoff clockwise** while playing notes
7. **Result:** The classic acid filter sweep that made the 303 famous!

### Self-Oscillation Mode
1. **Turn Resonance** to maximum (5 o'clock)
2. **Turn Cutoff** up until you hear the filter start singing
3. **Patch 1V/Oct CV** ‚Üí **CV1 Input** (use filter as oscillator)
4. **Congratulations!** You're now using the filter as a sine wave oscillator

## Essential Parameters (The Big 5)

### **1. Cutoff Knob (The Big One)**
- **What it does:** Controls filter frequency - where the filtering action happens
- **Musical result:** CCW = darker/bassier, CW = brighter/more harmonics
- **Extended range:** V2 has wider frequency range than original
- **Pro tip:** This is your primary performance control - big knob for big changes!

### **2. Resonance Knob**
- **What it does:** Emphasizes frequencies around the cutoff point
- **Musical result:** Low = smooth filtering, High = resonant peaks and self-oscillation
- **Self-oscillation:** At maximum, filter becomes a sine wave oscillator
- **Sweet spot:** 2-3 o'clock for classic acid resonance without self-oscillation

### **3. Mode Switch (LP/BP)**
- **LP (Lowpass):** Removes high frequencies above cutoff (12dB/oct slope)
- **BP (Bandpass):** Only passes frequencies near cutoff (6dB/oct)
- **Musical difference:** LP = warm/dark, BP = hollow/nasal character
- **No clicks:** V2 eliminates switching clicks for smooth transitions

### **4. Input Level**
- **What it does:** Controls how much signal hits the filter circuit
- **Musical result:** Higher levels drive the filter into saturation and distortion
- **Character control:** This affects the "color" and aggression of the filter
- **Sweet spot:** 12-3 o'clock for classic Polyvoks character

### **5. CV Inputs (CV1 + CV2 with Attenuverters)**
- **CV1:** Primary cutoff modulation with dedicated attenuverter
- **CV2:** Secondary cutoff modulation with attenuverter
- **Independent control:** Mix different modulation sources
- **Range:** -10V to +10V (extended range for modular compatibility)

- **Punchier bass:** Enhanced low-frequency response
- **Smoother controls:** More precise parameter adjustment

### **Historical Context:**
- **Russian synthesizer heritage:** Based on 1980s Soviet-era Formanta Polyvoks
- **Acid house foundation:** This filter sound defined entire musical genres
- **Legendary status:** One of the most sought-after filter characteristics in synthesis

## Beginner Patch Ideas

### **Patch 1: Classic Acid Bassline**
- **Sawtooth oscillator** ‚Üí Audio In
- **Bass sequence** ‚Üí Oscillator 1V/Oct
- **Mode:** LP (lowpass)
- **Envelope generator** ‚Üí CV1 Input (filter cutoff modulation)
- **Input Level:** 1 o'clock, Resonance: 2 o'clock
- **Result:** The quintessential acid bassline sound

### **Patch 2: Screaming Lead Synth**
- **Square/Saw oscillator** ‚Üí Audio In
- **Mode:** BP (bandpass) for hollow character
- **LFO** ‚Üí CV1 Input (slow filter sweeps)
- **Keyboard/Sequencer** ‚Üí CV2 Input (filter tracks pitch)
- **High Input Level + High Resonance** for aggressive character
- **Result:** Cutting lead sounds that slice through the mix

### **Patch 3: Filter as Oscillator**
- **Resonance:** Maximum (self-oscillation)
- **1V/Oct sequence** ‚Üí CV1 Input
- **LFO** ‚Üí CV2 Input (vibrato/tremolo)
- **No audio input needed** - filter generates its own tone
- **Mode switching** for different oscillator characters
- **Result:** Pure sine wave bass and lead sounds

## Advanced Techniques

### **Driving the Filter:**
- **Input Level as timbre control:** Higher levels = more saturation and grit
- **Sweet spots:** 10-11 o'clock for clean, 2-4 o'clock for driven character
- **Clipping the input:** Intentional overdrive for harsh, aggressive textures
- **Different input sources:** Try drums, noise, or complex waveforms

### **CV Modulation Strategies:**
- **Envelope ‚Üí CV1:** Classic filter envelope for dynamic brightness
- **LFO ‚Üí CV1:** Rhythmic filter sweeps and wobbles  
- **Sequencer ‚Üí CV2:** Filter follows melodic patterns
- **Mixed modulation:** Combine different CV sources for complex movement

### **Mode Switching Techniques:**
- **Performance switching:** Real-time mode changes for textural variation
- **Different resonance per mode:** LP and BP have different resonant characteristics
- **Bandpass filtering:** Creates hollow, vocal-like textures
- **Sequential mode switching:** Automate mode changes for evolving sounds

## Beginner "Gotchas" & Pro Tips

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:**

**"My filter sounds too clean/boring!"**
- Input Level might be too low - the character comes from driving the circuit
- **Solution:** Turn Input Level to 1-3 o'clock range for authentic Polyvoks grit

**"I can't get the filter to self-oscillate!"**
- Resonance needs to be at maximum, and cutoff in the right range
- **Solution:** Resonance fully clockwise, then sweep cutoff until oscillation starts

**"The resonance doesn't sound right!"**
- Different modes (LP/BP) have very different resonant characteristics
- **Solution:** Try both modes - BP often gives more dramatic resonance effects

### **üéµ Pro Tips:**

**Input Level Sweet Spots:**
- **9-11 o'clock:** Clean, smooth filtering
- **12-2 o'clock:** Classic Polyvoks character with some saturation
- **3-5 o'clock:** Aggressive, driven textures for harsh sounds

**Resonance Strategies:**
- **Low resonance (9-12 o'clock):** Smooth, musical filtering
- **Medium resonance (1-3 o'clock):** Classic acid house territory
- **High resonance (4-5 o'clock):** Self-oscillation and screaming leads

**CV Modulation Tips:**
- **Slow envelopes:** Classic filter envelope sweeps
- **Fast LFOs:** Wobble and rhythmic effects
- **Audio rate modulation:** FM-style effects when filter self-oscillates
- **Keyboard tracking:** Mix 1V/Oct with envelope for musical filter response

**Mode Selection Guide:**
- **Lowpass:** Warm, dark character - best for bass and smooth leads
- **Bandpass:** Hollow, nasal character - great for aggressive leads and vocal textures
- **Performance switching:** Use mode changes as dramatic arrangement tool
