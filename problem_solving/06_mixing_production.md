## Phase Problems: "My Bass Disappears in Mono"

### The Confusion

Your mix sounds huge and full in stereo - great bass, wide stereo field, everything sits perfectly. But when you check mono compatibility (or hear it on a mono bluetooth speaker), the bass vanishes, sounds get thin, and the mix falls apart. This is one of the most common and frustrating mixing problems.

### Why This Happens

**Phase cancellation destroys bass in mono** - When identical or similar signals are slightly delayed or inverted relative to each other, they can cancel out when summed to mono. Bass frequencies are most affected because they have long wavelengths.

**Technical reality:**
- **In phase:** Signals reinforce each other (louder)
- **Out of phase (180°):** Signals cancel completely (silence)
- **Partially out of phase:** Partial cancellation (comb filtering, thin sound)
- **Stereo hides problems:** Phase issues masked by stereo separation
- **Mono reveals problems:** Phase cancellation becomes obvious

### Visual Understanding

```
IN PHASE (signals reinforce):
Signal 1:  /\  /\  /\
Signal 2:  /\  /\  /\
Combined:  /\  /\  /\  (LOUDER)
           ↑↑  ↑↑  ↑↑

OUT OF PHASE (signals cancel):
Signal 1:  /\  /\  /\
Signal 2:  \/  \/  \/  (inverted)
Combined:  __  __  __  (SILENCE)
           ××  ××  ××

BASS IN STEREO (wide, sounds huge):
Left:  ___/‾‾‾\___
Right: ___/‾‾‾\___  (slightly different)
= Wide, powerful stereo image

BASS SUMMED TO MONO (cancellation):
Left + Right = partial cancellation
= Thin, weak bass
```

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: "Stereo bass trick destroys mono"**
- **Problem:** Used Haas effect or stereo widener on bass, sounds huge in stereo
- **Why:** Slight delay between left/right creates width but phase issues
- **Mono result:** Delayed signals cancel when summed, bass disappears
- **Solution:** Keep bass centered and mono below ~150Hz

**Scenario 2: "Layered sounds thin in mono"**
- **Problem:** Layered multiple synthesizers or samples for thick sound
- **Why:** Slight timing or tuning differences create phase issues
- **Stereo:** Sounds thick and wide
- **Mono:** Comb filtering makes sound hollow and thin
- **Solution:** Check mono compatibility, adjust timing/phase

**Scenario 3: "Bass and kick disappear on phone speaker"**
- **Problem:** Mix sounds great in studio, terrible on mono playback systems
- **Why:** Phone speakers, bluetooth speakers often sum to mono
- **Phase issues:** Not apparent in stereo, destroy mix in mono
- **Reality check:** Most casual listening is mono or near-mono
- **Solution:** Always check mono compatibility during mixing

### The Correct Approach

**Understanding phase relationships:**
```
PHASE CANCELLATION CAUSES:
✗ Stereo widening on bass frequencies
✗ Multiple microphones on same source (different distances)
✗ Layered sounds with slight timing differences
✗ Inverted polarity on one channel
✗ Room reflections creating comb filtering
✗ Poorly aligned samples or loops

PHASE-SAFE PRACTICES:
✓ Keep bass mono below 100-150Hz
✓ Center kick, bass, vocals (mono elements)
✓ Check mono compatibility regularly
✓ Use phase correlation meter
✓ Test on mono playback systems
```

**Preventing phase problems:**

**1. Keep low frequencies mono:**
```
FREQUENCY GUIDELINES:
0-100Hz: Always mono (sub-bass)
100-150Hz: Mostly mono (bass)
150-300Hz: Can be stereo (careful)
300Hz+: Stereo okay

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Use stereo imaging plugin with bass mono setting
- High-pass side channels below 150Hz
- Keep kick and bass completely centered
```

**2. Check mono compatibility:**
```
MONITORING WORKFLOW:
- Mix primarily in stereo
- Check mono frequently (every few minutes)
- Use mono button on monitor controller
- Or use utility plugin to sum to mono
- If something disappears in mono = phase problem

RED FLAGS:
- Bass/kick weak in mono
- Overall level drops significantly in mono
- Hollow, thin sound in mono
- Certain frequencies disappear
```

**3. Phase correlation meter:**
```
METER READING:
+1: Perfect correlation (mono)
0: No correlation (wide stereo, potentially problematic)
-1: Complete cancellation (inverted phase, disaster)

SAFE ZONE:
+0.5 to +1: Generally safe
0 to +0.5: Check for problems
Below 0: Fix immediately (phase issues)
```

**Fixing phase problems:**
```
DIAGNOSIS:
1. Solo problematic element
2. Check in mono - still disappears?
3. If yes: Phase issue in that element
4. If no: Phase issue in mix interaction

SOLUTIONS:

Stereo bass:
- Mono below 150Hz using EQ or imaging plugin
- Remove stereo widening from bass
- Center bass elements

Layered sounds:
- Nudge timing of layers
- Flip polarity on one layer (test if improves)
- Use phase alignment plugin
- Remove layers that cause cancellation

Multiple sources:
- Check polarity switches (not inverted)
- Align transients/timing
- Consider using only one source
```

**Testing methodology:**
1. **Reference mono playback:** Phone speaker, mono bluetooth speaker
2. **A/B comparison:** Stereo vs mono, note what disappears
3. **Fix issues:** Adjust problematic elements
4. **Verify:** Re-check mono, compare to reference tracks
5. **Final check:** Test on multiple mono systems

## Gain Staging: "Where Should My Levels Be?"

### The Confusion

You're not sure where levels should be at each stage of your signal chain. Sometimes things clip and distort, sometimes they're too quiet and noisy. The relationship between input gain, fader levels, and output levels seems confusing, and you're not sure what "proper gain staging" actually means.

### Why This Happens

**Gain staging is about signal-to-noise ratio and headroom** - Each stage in your signal chain should have enough level to overcome noise, but not so much that it clips or distorts. Proper gain staging optimizes this at every stage.

**Technical reality:**
- **Too low:** Noise becomes audible relative to signal
- **Too high:** Clipping, distortion, reduced headroom
- **Just right:** Clean signal with adequate headroom
- **Headroom:** Space between normal level and maximum (0dBFS digital)

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: "Everything clips on the master bus"**
- **Problem:** Individual channels too hot, sum exceeds 0dBFS
- **Why:** Each channel close to 0dB, combined signals clip
- **Math:** 8 channels at -6dB each = 0dB when summed (clipping)
- **Solution:** Lower individual channel levels, maintain headroom

**Scenario 2: "Turned everything down, now it's noisy"**
- **Problem:** Fixed clipping by drastically reducing all levels
- **Why:** Input gain too low, signal-to-noise ratio poor
- **Result:** Can hear noise floor, hiss, hum
- **Solution:** Proper gain staging at INPUT stage, not just faders

**Scenario 3: "Levels totally different in different DAWs/plugins"**
- **Problem:** Same sound clips in one DAW, fine in another
- **Why:** Different metering standards and headroom conventions
- **Digital meters:** Peak, RMS, LUFS all show different values
- **Solution:** Understand metering standards, aim for consistent headroom

### The Correct Approach

**Understanding gain stages:**
```
SIGNAL CHAIN:
Source → Input Gain → Channel Fader → Bus/Group → Master Fader → Output

Each stage should be optimized:
INPUT GAIN:
- Set for clean signal without clipping
- Aim for peaks around -12 to -6dBFS
- Maximize signal-to-noise ratio

CHANNEL FADER:
- Start at unity (0dB/U)
- Adjust for mix balance
- Typical working range: -10 to +3dB

BUS/GROUP:
- Sum of channels
- Should have 3-6dB headroom minimum
- Prevents clipping when combined

MASTER FADER:
- Final level control
- Target: -3 to -6dB for mixing (headroom for mastering)
- Never exceed 0dBFS (digital clipping)
```

**Proper gain staging workflow:**

**1. Set input gain (most important):**
```
FOR RECORDING:
- Adjust input gain on interface
- Aim for peaks around -12 to -6dBFS
- Should see healthy meter movement
- Leave headroom for unexpected peaks

FOR VIRTUAL INSTRUMENTS:
- Check output level on synth
- Many synths output too hot by default
- Reduce synth output if needed
- Aim for -12 to -6dBFS peaks
```

**2. Set channel faders:**
```
MIXING WORKFLOW:
- Start all faders at unity (0dB/U)
- Adjust relative levels for balance
- Don't push faders to maximum
- If you need more: Reduce other channels instead

HEADROOM MANAGEMENT:
- Individual channels: -6 to -12dB peak typical
- Sum of all channels: Should leave 3-6dB headroom
- If summed level too hot: Reduce individual channels
```

**3. Avoid clipping cascade:**
```
PROBLEM: Clipping at one stage affects all downstream stages

BAD PRACTICE:
Source clips → passes clipped signal → chain amplifies distortion
Plugin clips → distorted output → can't fix later

GOOD PRACTICE:
Clean signal at every stage → maximum flexibility
Headroom throughout chain → no cumulative clipping
```

**Digital vs analog levels:**
```
DIGITAL (0dBFS = absolute maximum):
- 0dBFS = clipping, distortion, bad
- No "going above zero" in fixed-point digital
- -6dBFS = good working level
- -12dBFS = safe, clean level

ANALOG (+4dBu, VU meters):
- 0VU = nominal level (not maximum)
- Headroom above 0VU before clipping
- More forgiving than digital
- Different metering standard
```

**Target levels by application:**
```
MIXING:
- Individual tracks: -12 to -6dB peaks
- Master bus: -6 to -3dB (leaves room for mastering)
- Never exceed 0dBFS

MASTERING:
- Input: -6 to -3dB (from mixing)
- Output: -0.1 to -0.3dB (maximized but not clipping)
- Use limiter for final level

STREAMING PLATFORMS:
- Target: -14 LUFS (Spotify, YouTube)
- If louder: Platform turns down (wasted effort)
- If quieter: May sound weak compared to others
```

## Wet/Dry Balance: "How Much Reverb/Delay?"

### The Confusion

You've added reverb or delay to a sound, but you're not sure how much is right. Too much and it's obviously drenched in effect, too little and you can't hear it. The wet/dry balance seems arbitrary and you're not confident in your choices.

### Why This Happens

**Wet/dry balance is context-dependent** - The "right" amount depends on genre, source material, desired space, and mix context. There's no universal setting.

**Technical reality:**
- **100% wet:** Effect only, no dry signal (rarely used)
- **100% dry:** Original only, no effect (effect off)
- **Mix:* Blend of dry and wet determines effect intensity

### The Correct Approach

**Understanding wet/dry:**
```
SEND/RETURN (PARALLEL):
- Dry signal stays at 100%
- Wet signal added on top
- More forgiving, easier to overdo
- Typical reverb approach

INSERT (SERIES):
- Wet/dry balance within plugin
- 50/50 = equal dry and wet
- 100% wet replaces dry signal
- More dramatic effect

TYPICAL RANGES:

Reverb (send/return):
- Subtle: 10-20% return level
- Normal: 20-40% return level
- Lush: 40-60% return level
- Special effect: 60%+ return level

Delay (send/return):
- Subtle: 15-30% return level
- Rhythmic: 30-50% return level
- Obvious: 50-70% return level

General guideline: If you notice the effect immediately, probably too much
```

**Practical approach:**
1. **Start with zero** - Hear dry signal
2. **Gradually add effect** - Increase wet level slowly
3. **Go too far** - Overdo it obviously
4. **Back off** - Reduce to where it enhances but doesn't dominate
5. **Check in context** - Solo often lies, check in full mix

## Frequency Masking: "Why Does My Mix Sound Muddy?"

### The Confusion

Your mix sounds muddy, unclear, or like everything is fighting for space. Individual elements sound great soloed, but together everything gets foggy and indistinct.

### Why This Happens

**Frequency masking occurs when sounds occupy the same frequency range** - Multiple elements competing in the same frequencies create buildup and mask each other, resulting in lack of clarity.

**Technical reality:**
- **Masking:** Louder sound hides quieter sound at same frequency
- **Frequency buildup:** Multiple sources adding up in same range
- **Critical frequencies:** 200-500Hz (muddy range), 2-4kHz (clarity range)

### The Correct Approach

**Preventing frequency masking:**
```
STRATEGIC EQ:

Identify conflicts:
- Bass and kick competing in 60-100Hz
- Multiple synths competing in 200-500Hz
- Vocals and guitars competing in 2-4kHz

Carve space:
- Reduce bass at kick fundamental frequency
- Cut midrange buildup (200-400Hz) on multiple sources
- Create pockets for each element

HIGH-PASS FILTER:
- Remove unnecessary low frequencies
- Don't need bass content in hi-hats, vocals, leads
- Typical: HPF everything except kick, bass, low toms

ARRANGEMENT:
- Fewer elements = less masking
- Frequency separation by design
- Bass occupies lows, lead occupies mids/highs
```

## Compression Ratios: "What Do These Numbers Mean?"

### The Confusion

Your compressor has ratio settings like 2:1, 4:1, 10:1, ∞:1, but you don't understand what they mean or which to use. Compression either seems to do nothing or completely squashes your sound.

### Why This Happens

**Compression ratio determines how much gain reduction occurs** - Higher ratios = more compression. But ratio alone doesn't tell the whole story - threshold, attack, and release matter equally.

**Technical reality:**
- **Ratio:** For every X dB over threshold, output increases by Y dB
- **2:1:** Gentle compression (2dB in = 1dB out over threshold)
- **4:1:** Moderate compression (4dB in = 1dB out)
- **10:1:** Heavy compression (10dB in = 1dB out)
- **∞:1:** Limiting (signal never exceeds threshold)

### The Correct Approach

**Understanding ratios:**
```
1:1 = No compression (input = output)

2:1 = Gentle/transparent
- Subtle level control
- Natural sound preservation
- Use for: Vocals, acoustic instruments, mix bus

4:1 = Moderate/obvious
- Noticeable compression
- Good control without destruction
- Use for: Drums, bass, most applications

8:1 = Heavy/aggressive
- Obvious effect
- Significant level control
- Use for: Parallel compression, drum bus, creative effect

∞:1 = Limiting
- Brick wall, signal cannot exceed threshold
- Use for: Mastering, peak control, preventing clipping
```

**Choosing ratio:**
1. **Start low (2:1-4:1)** - Most applications
2. **Set threshold** to where compression activates
3. **Adjust ratio** if need more/less compression
4. **Listen** - Transparent or obvious effect wanted?
5. **Check gain reduction** - meter - Aim for 3-6dB typical

## Quick Reference: Mixing and Production Troubleshooting

### "Bass disappears in mono"
1. **Check stereo width on bass** - Keep mono below 150Hz
2. **Phase correlation meter** - Should read above +0.5
3. **Remove stereo effects** from low frequencies
4. **Test on mono speaker** - Verify bass present

### "Everything clips/distorts"
1. **Check gain staging** - Input levels too hot?
2. **Reduce individual channels** - Not just master fader
3. **Leave headroom** - Target -6dB on master for mixing
4. **Check for clipping** at each stage in chain

### "Sounds great in headphones, terrible on speakers"
1. **Phase problems** - Check mono compatibility
2. **Bass too loud** - Headphones exaggerate bass
3. **Stereo too wide** - Speakers reveal phase issues
4. **Reference on multiple systems** regularly

### "Mix sounds muddy"
1. **Frequency masking** - Multiple elements same range?
2. **High-pass filter** - Remove unnecessary low frequencies
3. **Reduce 200-500Hz buildup** - Common mud zone
4. **Arrangement** - Too many elements competing?

### "Don't know how much compression"
1. **Start with 2:1 or 4:1** ratio (moderate)
2. **Set threshold** where compression activates
3. **Aim for 3-6dB gain reduction** (moderate)
4. **Listen** - Should enhance, not destroy
