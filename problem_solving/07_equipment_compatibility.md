## Impedance Matching: "Why Does This Connection Sound Bad?"

### The Confusion

You've connected two pieces of gear together - maybe a synthesizer to a mixer, or a guitar pedal to a modular input - and the sound is weak, thin, distorted, or just "wrong." The same cable works fine with other equipment, so it's not the cable. Something about this specific connection doesn't work right.

### Why This Happens

**Impedance mismatch causes signal degradation** - Every audio input and output has an impedance (electrical resistance to AC signals). When output impedance is too high relative to input impedance, you get level loss, frequency response changes, and potential distortion.

**Technical reality:**
- **Output impedance:** How much the source "resists" delivering signal
- **Input impedance:** How much the destination "resists" accepting signal
- **Rule of thumb:** Input impedance should be 10x output impedance minimum
- **Mismatch symptoms:** Weak signal, high frequency loss, distortion, loading

### Visual Understanding

```
GOOD IMPEDANCE MATCH:
Output: 600Ω → Input: 10kΩ (16:1 ratio)
Result: Strong signal, full frequency response ✓

POOR IMPEDANCE MATCH:
Output: 10kΩ → Input: 10kΩ (1:1 ratio)
Result: -6dB level loss, high frequency rolloff ✗

SEVERE MISMATCH:
Output: 50kΩ → Input: 600Ω (backwards!)
Result: Massive level loss, severe distortion ✗✗
```

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: "Guitar pedal to modular sounds weak and dull"**
- **Problem:** Guitar pedal output ~10kΩ, some modular inputs also ~10kΩ
- **Result:** Significant level drop, high frequency loss
- **Why:** 1:1 impedance ratio loads down pedal output
- **Solution:** Use buffer/preamp between pedal and modular
- **Alternative:** Choose modular input with high impedance (100kΩ+)

**Scenario 2: "Vintage synth sounds thin through modern mixer"**
- **Problem:** Old synth has high output impedance (10-50kΩ), mixer input designed for low-Z
- **Result:** Weak signal, lacks punch and presence
- **Why:** High output impedance can't drive modern low-Z inputs properly
- **Solution:** Use external preamp or DI box to buffer signal

**Scenario 3: "Passive mult causes oscillators to go out of tune"**
- **Problem:** Distributing pitch CV through passive mult to multiple destinations
- **Result:** Voltage sag, oscillators progressively flat (covered in Guide #1)
- **Why:** Each input draws current, causing voltage drop
- **Solution:** Use buffered multiple for critical CV signals

### The Correct Approach

**Understanding impedance levels:**
```
TYPICAL OUTPUT IMPEDANCES:
- Microphones: 150-600Ω (low)
- Line level (pro): 50-600Ω (low)
- Guitar pickups: 5-15kΩ (high)
- Guitar pedals: 1-10kΩ (medium-high)
- Vintage synths: 10-50kΩ (high)
- Modern synths: 100-1kΩ (low-medium)
- Modular VCOs: 1kΩ typical (low)

TYPICAL INPUT IMPEDANCES:
- Microphone preamps: 1-2kΩ (low)
- Line inputs (pro): 10kΩ+ (medium)
- Guitar amp inputs: 1MΩ (very high)
- Modular inputs: 10kΩ-100kΩ (medium-high)
- Modern audio interfaces: 10kΩ+ (medium)
```

**Matching guidelines:**
```
SAFE RATIOS (Input:Output):
10:1 or higher = Good match
5:1 = Acceptable, slight compromises
1:1 = Poor match, noticeable issues
Less than 1:1 = Severe problems

EXAMPLES:
✓ 600Ω out → 10kΩ in (16:1 ratio) = Excellent
✓ 1kΩ out → 10kΩ in (10:1 ratio) = Good
⚠ 10kΩ out → 10kΩ in (1:1 ratio) = Poor
✗ 10kΩ out → 600Ω in (0.06:1 ratio) = Disaster
```

**Solutions for impedance mismatch:**

**1. Use buffers/preamps:**
```
WHAT BUFFERS DO:
- Accept high-impedance input
- Output low-impedance signal
- No level change (unity gain)
- Prevent loading and signal degradation

WHERE TO USE:
- Guitar pedals → modular
- Vintage synths → modern mixers
- Long cable runs with high-Z sources
- Splitting signals to multiple destinations
```

**2. DI boxes (Direct Injection):**
```
FUNCTION:
- Convert high-impedance unbalanced to low-impedance balanced
- Often includes ground lift to prevent hum
- Matches guitar/instrument level to mic level

APPLICATIONS:
- Instruments → mixing console
- Synths → PA system
- Guitar → audio interface
- Long cable runs in live situations
```

**3. Check specifications:**
```
BEFORE CONNECTING:
1. Find output impedance of source
2. Find input impedance of destination
3. Calculate ratio (input ÷ output)
4. If less than 10:1, consider buffer

WHERE TO FIND SPECS:
- Equipment manuals (impedance section)
- Manufacturer websites
- "Output impedance" and "Input impedance" specs
- Sometimes called "source impedance" or "load impedance"
```

**Testing for impedance issues:**
1. **Connect gear, listen for problems:**
   - Weak level? → Likely impedance issue
   - High frequency loss? → Likely impedance issue
   - Distortion? → Possible impedance issue
2. **Compare with known good connection:**
   - Same source to different destination
   - Different source to same destination
3. **Try buffer/preamp:** If it fixes problem, was impedance mismatch

## Balanced vs Unbalanced: "When Does It Matter?"

### The Confusion

You see some equipment with XLR or TRS (balanced) connections, other equipment with TS or RCA (unbalanced) connections. You're not sure when balanced matters, whether you can mix balanced and unbalanced, or if it's just "professional" vs "consumer" gear.

### Why This Happens

**Balanced connections reject noise, unbalanced don't** - Balanced audio uses two signal conductors carrying opposite polarity signals, which allows noise rejection at the destination. Unbalanced uses single conductor plus ground, picking up noise along the way.

**Technical reality:**
- **Balanced:** Two conductors (hot/cold) carrying opposite signals + ground
- **Unbalanced:** One conductor carrying signal + ground
- **Noise rejection:** Balanced ~25-40dB better than unbalanced
- **Cable length:** Balanced works for long runs, unbalanced limited to ~20 feet

### Visual Understanding

```
BALANCED AUDIO:
Conductor 1: +signal (hot)
Conductor 2: -signal (cold, inverted)
Shield: Ground
At destination: Subtract cold from hot = signal × 2, noise cancels

UNBALANCED AUDIO:
Conductor: +signal
Shield: Ground
At destination: Use signal directly, noise included

NOISE REJECTION:
Balanced: Noise affects both conductors equally → cancels out
Unbalanced: Noise adds to signal → becomes part of audio
```

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: "Hum gets worse with longer cables"**
- **Problem:** Using unbalanced cables for long runs (20+ feet)
- **Why:** Longer cable = more antenna for electromagnetic interference
- **Result:** 60Hz hum, buzz, radio frequency interference
- **Solution:** Use balanced connections for any run over 15-20 feet

**Scenario 2: "Synth sounds fine at home, noisy in studio"**
- **Problem:** Unbalanced connections in electrically noisy environment
- **Why:** Studio has more equipment = more electromagnetic noise sources
- **Result:** Hum, buzz, interference not present at home
- **Solution:** Use balanced I/O or DI boxes for studio integration

**Scenario 3: "Mixing balanced and unbalanced causes problems"**
- **Problem:** Connected balanced output to unbalanced input (or vice versa)
- **Expectation:** Should work with adapter
- **Reality:** May work but lose noise rejection benefits
- **Understanding:** Balanced → Unbalanced loses protection, Unbalanced → Balanced no benefit

### The Correct Approach

**Understanding connector types:**
```
BALANCED CONNECTORS:
- XLR (3-pin): Professional standard, secure locking
- TRS (1/4" Tip-Ring-Sleeve): Balanced, also used for stereo
- TRS (3.5mm): Balanced in some pro equipment

UNBALANCED CONNECTORS:
- TS (1/4" Tip-Sleeve): Unbalanced mono, common in guitars/synths
- RCA (phono): Consumer audio standard, unbalanced
- 3.5mm TS: Unbalanced mono (not TRS stereo)

IDENTIFICATION:
- Two conductors + ground = balanced
- One conductor + ground = unbalanced
- Count rings on jack: 2 rings = balanced/stereo, 1 ring = unbalanced
```

**When balanced matters:**
```
USE BALANCED WHEN:
✓ Cable runs over 15-20 feet
✓ Electrically noisy environments (lots of equipment)
✓ Near power cables, dimmers, motors
✓ Professional studio integration
✓ Live sound applications
✓ Connecting to PA systems

UNBALANCED IS FINE:
✓ Short cable runs (<15 feet)
✓ Home studio with minimal interference
✓ Connections between nearby equipment
✓ Modular synthesizer patching (short cables)
✓ Desktop setup with clean power
```

**Converting between balanced and unbalanced:**
```
BALANCED OUTPUT → UNBALANCED INPUT:
Method: Use adapter or cable (TRS to TS, XLR to TS)
Result: Works but loses noise rejection
Consideration: Keep cable short to minimize noise pickup

UNBALANCED OUTPUT → BALANCED INPUT:
Method: Use adapter or cable (TS to TRS, TS to XLR)
Result: Works but no noise rejection benefit
Note: Won't damage anything, just no balanced advantage

PROPER CONVERSION:
Use DI box or transformer for true balanced/unbalanced conversion
Maintains proper signal levels and impedance matching
```

**Practical recommendations:**
```
HOME STUDIO SETUP:
- Synthesizers to nearby mixer: Unbalanced fine (short runs)
- Mixer to monitors: Balanced if possible (noise prevention)
- Any cable near power/computer: Balanced preferred
- Modular patching: Unbalanced fine (very short runs)

PROFESSIONAL STUDIO:
- All interconnects: Balanced (noise rejection critical)
- Long cable runs: Always balanced
- Patchbay: Balanced throughout
- Consumer gear: Use DI boxes for balanced integration

LIVE PERFORMANCE:
- Stage to FOH: Always balanced (long runs, noisy environment)
- Stage monitors: Balanced (near power, lights)
- Keyboards/synths: Balanced or use DI boxes
- Short jumpers on stage: Unbalanced acceptable
```

## Grounding and Ground Loops

### The Confusion

You have persistent hum or buzz in your audio signal - not present in individual pieces of gear, but appears when you connect everything together. Moving cables or lifting ground makes it better or worse. The hum seems to come from nowhere and everywhere at once.

### Why This Happens

**Ground loops create hum through multiple ground paths** - When equipment has multiple paths to ground, current flows through those paths, creating magnetic fields that induce hum in audio cables. This 60Hz hum (50Hz in some countries) is the classic "ground loop hum."

**Technical reality:**
- **Ground loop:** Multiple ground paths between connected equipment
- **Current flow:** Circulates through ground connections
- **Magnetic field:** Creates hum in nearby audio cables
- **Frequency:** 60Hz (US) or 50Hz (EU) from AC power

### Visual Understanding

```
GROUND LOOP PROBLEM:

Device A ──signal──> Device B
   |                    |
   └─ground─┬─ground────┘
            |
        [LOOP CURRENT FLOWS]
        Creates hum in audio

NO GROUND LOOP:

Device A ──signal──> Device B
   |                    |
   ground           ground (isolated)
   
   [NO LOOP, NO HUM]
```

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: "Hum when I connect synth to audio interface"**
- **Problem:** Both connected to same power strip, creates ground loop
- **Why:** Computer/interface ground + synth ground = multiple paths
- **Result:** 60Hz hum in audio signal
- **Solution:** Use ground lift on one device OR use DI box with ground lift

**Scenario 2: "Moving cables changes hum level"**
- **Problem:** Audio cables running parallel to power cables
- **Why:** Magnetic field from power cables induces hum in audio cables
- **Result:** Variable hum depending on cable positioning
- **Solution:** Separate power and audio cables, cross at 90° if must cross

**Scenario 3: "Hum only with certain equipment combinations"**
- **Problem:** Modular connected to guitar amp AND audio interface
- **Why:** Multiple ground paths through different connections
- **Result:** Hum appears only when all connected
- **Solution:** Isolate grounds, use balanced connections, ground lift on one path

### The Correct Approach

**Identifying ground loops:**
```
DIAGNOSIS STEPS:
1. Disconnect all audio cables
2. Reconnect one at a time
3. Note when hum appears
4. That connection creates the ground loop

CHARACTERISTICS:
- 60Hz hum (US) or 50Hz (EU) 
- Present even with no audio signal
- Changes with cable position
- Appears when equipment connected
- May have 120Hz/100Hz component (harmonic)
```

**Preventing ground loops:**

**1. Power distribution strategy:**
```
GOOD PRACTICE:
✓ All equipment on same power circuit
✓ Single power strip or distribution
✓ Star grounding (all grounds to one point)
✓ Avoid daisy-chaining power

BAD PRACTICE:
✗ Equipment on different circuits
✗ Multiple power strips from different outlets
✗ Mixing grounded and ungrounded equipment randomly
```

**2. Cable routing:**
```
BEST PRACTICES:
✓ Keep audio cables away from power cables
✓ Cross at 90° if must cross
✓ Use balanced connections when possible
✓ Shortest cable runs practical
✓ Quality shielded cables

AVOID:
✗ Audio cables parallel to power cables
✗ Audio and power in same cable bundle
✗ Coiling excess cable (creates antenna)
```

**3. Ground lift (use carefully):**
```
WHAT IT DOES:
- Breaks ground connection on one device
- Eliminates ground loop path
- Removes safety ground (potential hazard)

WHERE TO LIFT:
✓ DI box ground lift switch (safe)
✓ Balanced equipment with ground lift switch
✓ Transformer isolators (safe ground lift)

NEVER LIFT:
✗ Three-prong AC power ground (unsafe!)
✗ Equipment without ground lift switch
✗ As permanent solution without investigation

SAFETY NOTE:
Lifting ground can create shock hazard
Only lift grounds designed to be lifted
Never defeat three-prong AC power ground
```

**4. Isolation solutions:**
```
GROUND LOOP ISOLATORS:
- Transformer-based isolation
- Breaks ground loop without lifting safety ground
- Small amount of signal degradation
- Inexpensive solution for stubborn problems

DI BOXES:
- Often include ground lift switch
- Transformer provides isolation
- Converts to balanced (additional noise rejection)

BALANCED CONNECTIONS:
- Naturally more resistant to ground loops
- Differential signaling rejects common-mode interference
- Professional approach to ground loop prevention
```

**Troubleshooting workflow:**
1. **Identify problem:** Hum present, locate source
2. **Check cable routing:** Separate power and audio
3. **Try ground lift:** Use proper ground lift switches if available
4. **Use isolation:** DI box or ground loop isolator
5. **Power consolidation:** All equipment on same circuit
6. **Consider balanced:** Convert critical connections to balanced

## Cable Quality and Length Issues

### The Confusion

Some cables sound fine, others sound bad, but they all look the same. Or long cable runs sound weak or noisy, but short runs are fine. The relationship between cable quality, length, and audio quality seems arbitrary.

### Why This Happens

**Cable quality affects signal integrity** - Cheap cables have poor shielding (noise pickup), high resistance (level loss), and high capacitance (high frequency loss). Long runs amplify these problems.

**Technical reality:**
- **Resistance:** Higher resistance = level loss (not usually a problem unless extreme)
- **Capacitance:** High capacitance = high frequency rolloff
- **Shielding:** Poor shielding = noise pickup, interference
- **Length:** Longer cables = more resistance, capacitance, antenna effect

### The Correct Approach

**Understanding cable quality:**
```
QUALITY INDICATORS:
✓ Low capacitance (< 50pF per foot for instrument cables)
✓ Quality shielding (braided or served shield)
✓ Good connectors (gold-plated, strain relief)
✓ Proper wire gauge (22-24 AWG typical)
✓ Flexible but durable jacket

CHEAP CABLE PROBLEMS:
✗ High capacitance (dull, loss of highs)
✗ Poor shielding (noise pickup)
✗ Weak connectors (intermittent connection)
✗ Thin conductors (resistance issues)
```

**Length considerations:**
```
UNBALANCED CABLES:
- Keep under 15-20 feet when possible
- Longer = more capacitance = high frequency loss
- More antenna effect = noise pickup
- High-impedance sources most affected

BALANCED CABLES:
- Can run 50-100+ feet without issues
- Noise rejection maintains signal quality
- Professional installs use balanced for all long runs

MODULAR PATCH CABLES:
- Keep as short as practical
- Long patch cables pick up noise
- Excess cable length creates clutter
- Quality less critical (short runs, controlled environment)
```

**Practical recommendations:**
```
WHEN TO INVEST IN QUALITY:
✓ Long cable runs (20+ feet)
✓ High-impedance sources (guitar, vintage synths)
✓ Permanently installed cables
✓ Critical signal paths (master outputs)
✓ Electrically noisy environments

WHEN CHEAP IS FINE:
✓ Very short runs (< 3 feet)
✓ Modular patch cables
✓ Temporary test connections
✓ Non-critical signals
```

## Power Supply Considerations

### The Confusion

You notice that some equipment is noisy, hums, or creates interference with other gear. Power supplies seem identical, but some equipment sounds cleaner than others. Linear vs switching power supplies - you're not sure which is better or why it matters.

### Why This Happens

**Different power supply designs have different noise characteristics** - Switching power supplies are efficient but can create high-frequency noise. Linear supplies are cleaner but larger, heavier, and less efficient.

**Technical reality:**
- **Linear supplies:** Clean DC, no switching noise, heavy and inefficient
- **Switching supplies:** Efficient and compact, but can create RF interference
- **Grounding:** Poor power supply grounding causes hum and noise
- **Multiple supplies:** Different supply voltages can create ground loops

### The Correct Approach

**Understanding power supply types:**
```
LINEAR POWER SUPPLIES:
Advantages:
✓ Very low noise
✓ No RF interference
✓ Excellent regulation
✓ Preferred for analog audio

Disadvantages:
✗ Large and heavy
✗ Inefficient (generates heat)
✗ More expensive

SWITCHING POWER SUPPLIES:
Advantages:
✓ Compact and lightweight
✓ Efficient (less heat)
✓ Cost-effective
✓ Wide input voltage range

Disadvantages:
✗ Can generate RF noise
✗ May cause interference
✗ Require good filtering

WHEN IT MATTERS:
- Sensitive analog circuits prefer linear
- Digital equipment fine with switching
- Modular synthesizers often prefer linear
- Modern well-designed switching supplies very clean
```

**Power supply noise prevention:**
```
GOOD PRACTICES:
✓ Quality power supplies from manufacturers
✓ Keep power supplies away from audio circuits
✓ Use shielded power cables in modular
✓ Adequate power supply capacity for all modules
✓ Proper grounding throughout system

TROUBLESHOOTING NOISY SUPPLIES:
1. Disconnect suspected power supply
2. Use battery/isolated power temporarily
3. If noise disappears → power supply issue
4. Replace with higher quality supply
```
