# Noise Engineering Numeric Repetitor - Beginner's Guide

**The Mathematical Rhythm Generator**

---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Prime Rhythm in 5 Minutes

**What is Numeric Repetitor?** Think of it as a rhythm generator that uses mathematics rather than traditional step sequencing. It creates gate patterns based on binary arithmetic and prime number theory - but don't worry, you don't need to understand the math to use it! It contains 32 carefully curated "prime rhythms" that sound good, and generates variations by multiplying these patterns as binary numbers. It's perfect for creating complex polyrhythms with simple controls.

### Your First Mathematical Beat
1. **Connect your master clock** ‚Üí **BEAT input**
2. **Connect PRIME output** ‚Üí **kick drum or main percussion**
3. **Turn PRIME knob** slowly and listen to different rhythmic patterns
4. **Try the X/Y switch** to access the second set of 16 patterns
5. **Connect PRODUCT 1 output** ‚Üí **second percussion voice**
6. **Turn PRODUCT 1 knob** to create rhythmic variations

**Congratulations!** You've just created polyrhythmic patterns using mathematical principles!

## Beginner "Gotchas"

### **It's Not a Traditional Step Sequencer**
- **No step programming:** You can't manually program beats like TR-808
- **Mathematical generation:** Patterns come from algorithms, not step entry
- **32 preset patterns:** You choose from pre-calculated prime rhythms
- **Variation through math:** Product outputs use multiplication, not manual editing
- **Different mindset:** Think "pattern selection" not "beat programming"

### **Requires External Clock**
- **No internal clock:** Must have external beat source to function
- **Clock dependent:** No clock input = no output
- **Clock division/multiplication:** Works with any reasonable clock speed
- **Sync important:** Use MEASURE input to stay locked with other modules
- **Rising edge sensitive:** Timing comes from clock transitions

### **Product Knobs Are Time Offsets, Not Pattern Editors**
- **Common confusion:** Product knobs don't select different patterns
- **Time offset control:** They shift the mathematical variation in time
- **Related to Prime:** All Products are variations of the selected Prime
- **Subtle changes:** Small knob movements often more musical than large ones
- **Interactive:** Product patterns change when you change Prime pattern

### **CV Input Behavior**
- **7V range:** Full CV range needed to access all 16 patterns
- **Stepping:** CV changes create jumps between patterns, not smooth transitions
- **Quantized input:** CV gets converted to pattern numbers (no in-between)
- **Modulation speed:** Slow CV changes more musical than fast ones
- **Pattern jumping:** Fast CV can create rhythmic chaos (sometimes desired!)

### **X/Y Switch Doubles Your Patterns**
- **Two complete sets:** X and Y each have 16 different prime rhythms
- **Different characters:** X and Y sets have different rhythmic feels
- **Easy to forget:** Check which set you're using when pattern doesn't sound right
- **No CV control:** Switch position must be changed manually
- **Performance limitation:** Can't sequence between X and Y sets

---

## Next Steps

1. **Explore all 32 prime patterns** - spend time with each X and Y pattern
2. **Practice Product knob control** - learn subtle vs dramatic offset effects
3. **Experiment with different clock speeds** - same patterns, different feels
4. **Try CV modulation** - sequence through patterns for evolving rhythms
5. **Study the mathematical relationships** - notice how Products relate to Prime
6. **Integrate with other modules** - use as trigger source for complex patches

**Remember:** You don't need to understand the math - just listen and explore the relationships!
