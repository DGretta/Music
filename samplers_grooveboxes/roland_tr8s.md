# Roland TR-8S
**ACB Rhythm Performer with 11-Track Drum Machine, Sample Import, 64-Step Sequencer, and Deep Modular Integration**

*Digital modeling of classic Roland drum machines (808/909/707/606) plus user sampling, extensive effects, trigger outputs, and performance features designed for modular systems and live sets*

## Quick Start
**First pattern in 3 minutes:** Power on TR-8S → Press [PTN SELECT] + pad [1] (bank 1) → Release [PTN SELECT] → Press pad [1] (pattern 1-1) → Press [TR-REC] → Press [BD] → Press step pads [1, 5, 9, 13] for kicks → Press [SD] → Press pads [5, 13] for snare → Press [CH] → Press all pads [1-16] for hi-hats → Press [START/STOP] to play → Adjust [VOLUME] knob.

**Modular sync setup:** Connect TR-8S TRIGGER OUT (mini jack rear panel) to modular clock input → Press [UTILITY] → Navigate to SYNC/TEMPO → Set "Sync Mode" to INTERNAL (TR-8S as master) → Set trigger out to send clock pulses → Your modular now follows TR-8S tempo → Use ASSIGNABLE OUT 1-6 jacks (1/4" front panel) to send individual instrument triggers to modular envelope/gates.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### **"I programmed a pattern but it disappeared - my drum programming vanished!"**
**Problem:** TR-8S has complex save system with three separate entities (Pattern, Kit, System) that must be saved independently, pattern edits not saved before switching patterns

**Why This Matters:** Unlike simpler drum machines with one "save" function, TR-8S separates pattern data (rhythm/steps) from kit data (sounds/effects) from system data (global settings). You can program perfect 909 pattern, switch to different pattern to compare, original pattern reverts to last-saved state. The manual states "parameters of the pattern or kit that you're editing are remembered until you turn off the power" but this is misleading - they're remembered only until you select different pattern/kit. The machine has no auto-save, no undo, no "unsaved changes" warning. Professional workflow requires saving constantly or using the OVERWRITE shortcut (SHIFT+WRITE) which simultaneously saves pattern AND kit. This catches users programming for 30 minutes, switching patterns, losing all work. The confusion deepens because Roland designed three save modes: (1) save pattern only, (2) save kit only, (3) save system only - you must consciously choose correct mode. Beginners think "I pressed WRITE button, my work is saved" but they saved the wrong thing.

**Solution:**
- **Use OVERWRITE shortcut constantly:** Hold [SHIFT] + press [WRITE] - saves both pattern AND kit simultaneously
- **Verify what you're saving:** When [WRITE] menu appears, shows "Pattern" → "Kit" → "System" in sequence - press [ENTER] at correct stage
- **Save after every significant change:** Programmed 8-bar variation? SHIFT+WRITE. Adjusted kick tuning? SHIFT+WRITE. Changed effect? SHIFT+WRITE.
- **Understand the entities:**
  - PATTERN = step data, motion data, last step settings, which kit to use
  - KIT = all 11 instrument sounds, effects settings, reverb/delay, assignments
  - SYSTEM = global MIDI/sync settings, utility preferences
- **Dedicated save shortcuts:**
  - Save pattern only: Hold [WRITE] + press [PTN SELECT]
  - Save kit only: Hold [WRITE] + press [KIT]
  - Save both: Hold [SHIFT] + press [WRITE]

### **"Trigger outputs don't send gates to my modular - nothing triggers!"**
**Problem:** ASSIGNABLE OUT jacks default to audio output mode (not trigger mode), must be explicitly set to TRIGGER mode per jack, instrument assignments not configured

**Why This Matters:** TR-8S has two types of external outputs for modular integration: (1) dedicated TRIGGER OUT mini jack (rear panel, always sends dedicated trigger track programmed via [CC]+[RC] buttons), (2) six ASSIGNABLE OUT 1-6 quarter-inch jacks (front panel, switchable between audio out or trigger out per jack). Factory default: all ASSIGNABLE OUT jacks are in audio/boost mode (standard audio outputs), NOT trigger mode. Users connect ASSIGNABLE OUT 1 to modular envelope generator expecting +5V triggers, get audio signal instead, modular doesn't respond. The confusion: manual says jacks are "ASSIGNABLE OUT/TRIGGER OUT" implying they do both simultaneously - they don't. Each jack operates in one mode at a time. The setup workflow requires: (1) enter UTILITY menu, (2) navigate to ASSIGN OUT 1-6 section, (3) change "Mode" from BOOST/AUDIO to TRIGGER for each jack you want as trigger, (4) exit UTILITY, (5) enter KIT EDIT menu, (6) navigate to OUTPUT section, (7) assign specific instruments to ASSIGN 1-6, (8) save kit. Eight-step configuration for something that should be plug-and-play.

**Solution:**
- **Set jacks to TRIGGER mode:** [UTILITY] → scroll to "ASSIGN OUT 1" → press [ENTER] → scroll to "Mode" → press [ENTER] → select "TRIGGER" → press [ENTER] → repeat for outputs 2-6 as needed
- **Assign instruments to trigger outputs:** Hold [SHIFT] + press [KIT] (KIT Edit menu) → scroll to "OUTPUT" → press [ENTER] → scroll to instrument (BD, SD, etc.) → press [ENTER] → select "ASSIGN 1" (or 2-6) → press [ENTER] → repeat for each instrument → press [KIT] to exit → save kit
- **Verify trigger voltage:** TR-8S triggers are +5V 1ms pulses (S-trigger standard), compatible with most modular (Eurorack/Buchla/Serge)
- **Dedicated TRIGGER OUT jack:** Rear panel mini jack sends triggers programmed in special trigger track (hold [CC] + press [RC] during TR-REC) - use this for master clock or specific rhythmic gates independent of drum sounds
- **Test before performance:** Connect trigger output to modular VCA with envelope, trigger TR-8S pattern, verify modular envelope responds - if no response, check mode/assignment/cables

### **"My kit sounds wrong - the 808 bass drum sounds like 909, snare is completely different!"**
**Problem:** TR-8S patterns reference kit numbers but don't store kit data within pattern, loading pattern that references different kit than intended, kit was edited/overwritten after pattern creation

**Why This Matters:** Pattern-kit relationship in TR-8S is reference-based (pointer system) not embedded. Pattern 1-1 says "use Kit 5" but doesn't contain Kit 5's data - when you load Pattern 1-1, machine loads whatever is currently saved as Kit 5. If you: (1) create Pattern 1-1 with Kit 5 (808 bass, tight snare), (2) later edit Kit 5 to completely different sounds (909 bass, gated reverb snare), (3) load Pattern 1-1 again - you hear the NEW Kit 5, not original. The pattern's rhythm is intact but sounds are different. This catches users building song with consistent drum sound across patterns 1-1 through 1-8, all referencing Kit 1. Then they edit Kit 1 for one specific breakdown section, suddenly ALL eight patterns sound different because they all point to the same kit. Roland designed this for flexibility (one kit edit updates all patterns using it) but beginners expect "pattern sounds like it did when I made it." The PTN SETTING menu has "KIT:SW" and "KIT:Number" parameters controlling whether pattern uses its assigned kit or currently-selected kit, adding another layer of confusion.

**Solution:**
- **Understand pattern-kit relationship:** Pattern stores rhythm/steps PLUS kit number reference, not actual kit data
- **Dedicated kits per pattern:** If Pattern 1-1 needs specific 808 character, assign unique kit (Kit 1), don't share kits between patterns with different sound requirements
- **Check pattern's kit assignment:** Hold [SHIFT] + press [PTN SELECT] (PTN SETTING menu) → verify "KIT:Number" shows correct kit → if wrong, change it → save pattern
- **Copy kits before editing:** Before modifying kit used by multiple patterns, copy kit to new slot: hold [COPY] + press [KIT] → select source kit → select empty destination → press [ENTER]. Now edit the copy without affecting original patterns
- **KIT:SW parameter:** In PTN SETTING menu, "KIT:SW" determines if pattern loads its assigned kit automatically (ON) or uses whatever kit is currently selected (OFF) - leave ON for consistent sound
- **Systematic kit organization:** Kits 1-16 for 808 variations, Kits 17-32 for 909, Kits 33-48 for sampled drums, etc. Prevents accidental overwrites

### **"Samples won't import - SD card keeps showing errors!"**
**Problem:** SD card not formatted by TR-8S (formatted by computer instead), sample files not in correct folder structure, SD card write-protected, card removed during operation

**Why This Matters:** TR-8S is extremely particular about SD card formatting and file structure. You cannot format SD card on Mac/Windows then use it - must format within TR-8S itself (UTILITY → SD CARD:Format). The machine creates specific folder structure: ROLAND/TR-8S/SAMPLE/ for import files, ROLAND/TR-8S/BACKUP/ for backup data. Placing audio files anywhere else = TR-8S can't see them. The import workflow: (1) format SD card in TR-8S, (2) eject card, (3) insert into computer, (4) copy WAV/AIFF files into ROLAND/TR-8S/SAMPLE/ folder, (5) eject safely from computer, (6) insert into TR-8S, (7) UTILITY → Sample Import. Skipping step 1 or putting files in wrong folder = "Read Error!" messages. Additional gotchas: SD card has physical write-protect switch (slide to LOCK position = read-only, can't format), removing card while "Executing" message shows = corrupted card, sample file exceeds ~180 seconds mono 44.1kHz = import fails. Roland doesn't explain that different sample rates/bit depths affect maximum import length - 96kHz stereo file maxes out faster than 44.1kHz mono.

**Solution:**
- **Format SD card in TR-8S first (always):** [UTILITY] → scroll to "SD CARD:Format" → [ENTER] → select "OK" → [ENTER] → wait for "Completed" message
- **Verify write-protect switch:** Physical switch on SD card side must be in unlocked position (opposite of LOCK)
- **Correct folder structure:** After formatting in TR-8S, use computer to navigate: ROLAND/TR-8S/SAMPLE/ - place all import WAV/AIFF files here
- **Supported formats:** WAV or AIFF, mono or stereo, 44.1kHz/48kHz/96kHz, 16-bit or 24-bit
- **Sample length limits:** Maximum ~180 seconds for 44.1kHz mono, shorter for higher sample rates or stereo files - keep samples under 3 minutes to be safe
- **Import procedure:** [UTILITY] → "Sample Import" → [ENTER] → select file → [ENTER] → confirm "OK" → [ENTER] → wait for "Completed!"
- **Never remove card during operation:** "Executing..." or "Reading..." messages mean SD card is active - removing card corrupts data and potentially damages card
- **Quality SD cards only:** Use reputable brands (SanDisk, Samsung, etc.), 4GB-32GB capacity, Class 10 speed rating minimum

### **"Pattern is 32 steps but I only see 16 - half my pattern is missing!"**
**Problem:** TR-8S has 16 step buttons displaying 64-step patterns via 4 banks, visual display doesn't automatically follow playback, confusing bank navigation

**Why This Matters:** TR-8S can program patterns up to 64 steps but only has 16 step button pads. Solution: four banks of 16 steps each (steps 1-16, 17-32, 33-48, 49-64). The << and >> arrows beside [LAST] button manually navigate between banks. During TR-REC, you can program steps 1-16 (bank 1), press >> to see steps 17-32 (bank 2), program those, etc. The confusion: during playback, playhead indicator (white LED) moves across pads [1]-[16] showing current step... until step 17 when playhead is no longer visible (playing bank 2 but viewing bank 1). Unlike Elektron machines with automatic page-following, TR-8S view stays on manually-selected bank unless you navigate. Users program 16-step pattern, want to extend to 32 steps, press [LAST] button intending to change length, still see steps 1-16, think machine is broken. Reality: they successfully created 32-step pattern but are viewing wrong bank. The bank indicators (four small LEDs above step pads labeled 16/32/48/64) show: white LED = playhead location, red LED = viewed bank. When different, you're looking at steps that aren't playing.

**Solution:**
- **Learn bank indicators:** Four LEDs above pads: white = playhead position, red = your view
- **Navigate banks manually:** Use << and >> arrows beside [LAST] button to switch viewed bank
- **Program long patterns systematically:**
  1. Press [TR-REC]
  2. Press [LAST] → Press >> until "32" indicator → Press pad [16] (sets 32-step length)
  3. Program instruments for steps 1-16 normally
  4. Press >> arrow once (view advances to steps 17-32)
  5. Program instruments for steps 17-32
  6. Press [START/STOP] - entire 32-step pattern plays
- **Watch playhead during playback:** White LED shows current step - if it disappears after pad [16], playhead is in different bank than your view
- **Per-track last step:** Can set different loop lengths per instrument (polymeter) - bass drum 16 steps, snare 15 steps, hats 14 steps = evolving patterns
- **Maximum complexity:** 64 steps × 11 instruments × motion automation = extremely dense programming possible, far beyond 16-button display capacity

### **"MIDI sync from DAW doesn't work - tempo is right but TR-8S won't start!"**
**Problem:** DAW sends MIDI clock (tempo) but not MIDI start/stop messages, TR-8S waiting for start command that never arrives, or sync source set to internal when should be external

**Why This Matters:** MIDI sync has two components: (1) MIDI clock messages (F8) send 24 pulses per quarter note establishing tempo, (2) MIDI start (FA) and stop (FC) messages tell device when to begin/end playback. Many DAWs send clock by default but require explicit setting to send start/stop. TR-8S correctly receives tempo (display shows DAW tempo) but [START/STOP] button does nothing - TR-8S is waiting for MIDI start byte. Users think "tempo is synced, why won't it play?" The answer: tempo is informational (machine knows 120 BPM) but playback requires start command. Additionally, TR-8S "Sync Mode" in UTILITY must be set correctly: INTERNAL (master, ignores external clock), MIDI (slave to 5-pin DIN MIDI), USB (slave to USB MIDI) - wrong mode = no sync. Common scenario: TR-8S connected via USB to computer, user presses play in DAW, TR-8S sits silent because (1) sync mode is INTERNAL (ignoring USB entirely), or (2) sync mode is USB but DAW not sending start, or (3) sync mode is MIDI but connection is USB (wrong input).

**Solution:**
- **Set TR-8S sync source:** [UTILITY] → "SYNC/TEMPO: Sync Mode" → select "USB" (if connected via USB) or "MIDI" (if using 5-pin DIN cable) → exit UTILITY
- **Enable DAW start/stop transmission:**
  - Ableton Live: Preferences → Link/MIDI → MIDI Ports → TR-8S output port → enable "Track" and "Sync"
  - Logic Pro: File → Project Settings → Synchronization → enable "Send MIDI Clock" and "Send MIDI Start/Stop" for TR-8S
  - FL Studio: Options → MIDI Settings → TR-8S output → enable "Send master sync"
  - Bitwig: Settings → Controllers → add Generic MIDI Keyboard → set TR-8S port → enable "MIDI Clock Output"
- **Test sync:**
  1. Press play in DAW - TR-8S should start automatically
  2. Stop in DAW - TR-8S should stop
  3. Change DAW tempo - TR-8S tempo display should follow
  4. If no response, verify sync mode and DAW start/stop settings
- **Manual start alternative:** If DAW sends clock but not start, set TR-8S to external sync (USB/MIDI), manually press [START/STOP] on TR-8S - tempo follows DAW, start/stop is manual
- **Hermod+ integration:** For modular sync, connect Hermod+ clock output to TR-8S TRIGGER OUT input via sync cable, set TR-8S "Sync Mode" to INTERNAL (TR-8S as master), configure Hermod+ as slave receiving TR-8S clock
  
### **"Motion data is recording when I don't want it - knob movements saved automatically!"**
**Problem:** MOTION [REC] button left ON, every knob/fader movement records into pattern as automation, unintended automation plays back changing sounds

**Why This Matters:** Motion recording (parameter automation) is powerful but destructive feature. When MOTION [REC] button is lit red, every movement of instrument [TUNE], [DECAY], [CTRL] knobs, REVERB/DELAY/MASTER FX knobs, and level faders is recorded per-step as automation data. During playback with MOTION [ON] lit, recorded movements play back automatically even if you don't touch knobs. This seems useful (record filter sweep once, plays back every loop) but becomes nightmare when unintentional. User tweaks kick tuning to audition different pitches, doesn't realize MOTION [REC] is active, accidentally records 16 different tuning values across 16 steps. Now kick plays back with wild pitch variations. Or user adjusts reverb level searching for sweet spot, motion recording captures every turn, playback sounds erratic. The visual feedback is subtle: MOTION [REC] button red = recording active, MOTION [ON] button green = playback active. Buttons can be in different states: [REC] off but [ON] on = playing back old recordings without recording new, [REC] on but [ON] off = recording new but not playing back (confusing because you don't hear result), both on = recording AND playing back. No warning when you're about to overwrite existing motion data.

**Solution:**
- **Check MOTION [REC] before knob tweaking:** If solid red, you're recording - press [REC] to disable if you don't want automation
- **Intentional motion workflow:**
  1. Program pattern without motion first
  2. Verify pattern rhythm/steps are correct
  3. Press MOTION [REC] (lights red)
  4. Press [START/STOP] to play pattern
  5. Move ONE knob to record automation (e.g., filter sweep)
  6. Press MOTION [REC] (turns off) - automation captured
  7. Press MOTION [ON] (lights green) - automation plays back
  8. Save pattern to keep motion data
- **Clear unwanted motion:**
  - All motion in variation: Hold MOTION [ON] + press [CLEAR]
  - Specific track motion: Hold MOTION [ON] + press instrument select button [BD]-[RC]
  - Specific knob motion: Hold MOTION [ON] + turn the knob
- **View motion data:** Hold [SHIFT] + press [INST] → can see/edit motion values per step
- **Motion survives pattern copy:** Copying pattern copies motion data - doesn't clear it

### **"ACB sounds different from real 808/909 - not authentic!"**
**Problem:** User expects identical clone, ACB is component-level modeling (extremely accurate) but not bit-identical, user comparison using poor-quality reference recordings, or user unfamiliar with how real vintage machines varied

**Why This Matters:** ACB (Analog Circuit Behavior) is Roland's component-level modeling technology analyzing original circuit boards to model individual transistors, resistors, capacitors. Result is extremely accurate but not sample-playback (doesn't play recordings of original). Each TR-8S voice is real-time synthesis based on circuit behavior, meaning knob movements affect sound like analog (not fixed sample). Differences from real 808/909: (1) real vintage machines varied between units due to component aging/tolerances, (2) real vintage machines drifted with temperature/voltage, (3) real vintage machines had noisy power supplies affecting sound. ACB models "ideal" circuit behavior without random noise/drift. To trained ears, TR-8S sounds "cleaner" than crusty 40-year-old machine. But ACB captures the musical character: 808 bass drum pitch decay envelope, snare noise generator snap, cymbal decay curve, etc. Users comparing TR-8S to heavily processed/compressed 808 samples think "doesn't sound the same" when actually hearing difference between clean ACB and post-processed sample. The expectation problem: YouTube videos titled "TR-8S vs Real 808" using terrible audio recording chains, mono phone mics, YouTube compression - differences are recording quality not instrument quality.

**Solution:**
- **Understand what ACB is:** Real-time circuit modeling, not sample playback - sounds react dynamically to parameter changes like analog
- **Tune for authentic character:** Real 808s varied unit-to-unit, tweak [TUNE]/[DECAY]/[TONE] knobs to match your reference
- **Consider the source:** Comparing to heavily compressed/saturated 808 samples? Add Master FX (bit crusher/saturation) to TR-8S for closer match
- **Room acoustics matter:** TR-8S through studio monitors in treated room sounds different than 808 through vintage mixer into tape - recording chain matters more than model accuracy
- **ACB advantages over analog:**
  - Perfect recall (no drift/temperature issues)
  - No maintenance/recapping required
  - More tuning range than originals
  - Stereo imaging impossible on vintage
  - Individual outputs for all 11 voices (808/909 had limited outs)
- **If absolute authenticity required:** Use TR-8S to trigger modular analog percussion through TRIGGER OUT, combine ACB and analog

### **"Sample playback cuts off suddenly - imported drums don't play full length!"**
**Problem:** Sample "Trigger" setting incorrect, "Gate" setting wrong, "One Shot" vs "Loop" mode mismatch, or instrument DECAY parameter set too short

**Why This Matters:** TR-8S sample engine has multiple parameters determining playback behavior, none of which are obvious. When you import sample and assign to instrument, defaults may not match your intention. SAMPLE EDIT parameters: (1) Start Point (where sample begins playing), (2) End Point (where sample stops), (3) Trigger (how note retriggers sample), (4) Gate (whether key-off stops sample), (5) One Shot vs Loop playback. Additionally, INST EDIT has DECAY knob affecting sample length. Common scenario: import 3-second kick drum sample, trigger from pad, only hear 0.5 seconds. Reason: instrument DECAY is short. User turns DECAY to maximum, kick plays full length. Or: import vocal sample for chopping, press pad, sample plays once and stops (One Shot mode) when user expected continuous loop. Or: import hi-hat sample, press pad, hi-hat cuts off when pad released (Gate = ON) when user wanted full decay regardless of pad release. The Roland manual doesn't explain default behaviors clearly, forcing trial-and-error learning. The sample parameters hide in SAMPLE EDIT menu requiring: hold [SHIFT] + press [SAMPLE] to access.

**Solution:**
- **Check instrument DECAY first:** Turn instrument [DECAY] knob fully clockwise - if sample plays full length, DECAY was the culprit
- **Access SAMPLE EDIT:** Hold [SHIFT] + press [SAMPLE] → navigates to edit parameters for currently-selected sample
- **Critical sample parameters:**
  - **One Shot vs Loop:** One Shot = plays once per trigger, Loop = repeats continuously (useful for sustained sounds)
  - **Gate:** ON = sample stops when pad released, OFF = sample plays full length regardless of pad release (set OFF for most drums)
  - **Trigger:** GATE = sample restarts each trigger, ONESHOT = sample plays to end ignoring new triggers (affects sample chopping behavior)
  - **Start/End Point:** Defines which portion of sample plays - adjust if only playing part of file
- **Systematic sample setup:**
  1. Import sample: [UTILITY] → Sample Import
  2. Assign to instrument: [SAMPLE] → select sample → assign to [BD]-[RC]
  3. Test playback: Press instrument pad
  4. Edit if needed: Hold [SHIFT] + [SAMPLE] → adjust Gate/One Shot/Start/End
  5. Save sample settings (affects all kits using sample)
  6. Save kit (saves instrument assignment)
- **Sample-per-pad workflow:** Assign different samples to each of 11 instruments for sample chops, use step sequencer to trigger in rhythm

### **"Reverb/delay sounds wrong - effects don't match what I programmed!"**
**Problem:** Reverb/delay are kit-level effects (not pattern-level), changing kit changes effect settings, user expects effects to be global or pattern-specific

**Why This Matters:** TR-8S effect hierarchy: Master FX (global to entire kit), Reverb (kit-level, send-based), Delay (kit-level, send-based). Each kit stores its own reverb/delay type and parameters. Pattern doesn't store effect settings - pattern references kit number, kit contains effect settings. If you program Pattern 1-1 with Kit 5 (hall reverb, long delay), then load Pattern 1-2 which uses Kit 8 (plate reverb, short delay), effects sound completely different. The [REVERB] and [DELAY] knobs on front panel adjust send levels (how much signal sent to effects) but not effect type/parameters. Effect types and detailed parameters require diving into KIT EDIT menu: hold [SHIFT] + press [KIT] → select REVERB or DELAY category. Available reverb types: ROOM, HALL, PLATE, SPRING - each with unique character and parameters (time, density, damping). Available delay types: SINGLE (one delay line), PAN (stereo ping-pong), DUBL (double delay), FDBK (feedback-heavy), RVRS (reverse), SHFL (shuffling repeats), +RVB (delay into reverb). Users twist [REVERB LEVEL] and [DELAY LEVEL] knobs expecting different reverb/delay but only changing send amount, not type.

**Solution:**
- **Understand effect hierarchy:**
  - Front panel knobs = send levels (amount)
  - KIT EDIT menu = effect types/parameters (character)
  - Saved in KIT not PATTERN
- **Change reverb type/parameters:** Hold [SHIFT] + press [KIT] → scroll to "REVERB" → press [ENTER] → select "Type" → choose ROOM/HALL/PLATE/SPRING → adjust Time/Pre Delay/Density → press [KIT] to exit → save kit
- **Change delay type/parameters:** Hold [SHIFT] + press [KIT] → scroll to "DELAY" → press [ENTER] → select "Type" → choose SINGLE/PAN/DUBL/etc → adjust Time/Feedback → press [KIT] to exit → save kit
- **Front panel quick access:**
  - [REVERB LEVEL] knob: How much signal sent to reverb
  - Hold [KIT] + turn [REVERB LEVEL]: Reverb time length
  - [DELAY LEVEL] knob: How much signal sent to delay
  - [DELAY TIME] knob: Delay repeat speed
  - [DELAY FEEDBACK] knob: Delay repeat count
- **Per-instrument send control:** In INST EDIT, each instrument has independent send level to reverb/delay - bass drum can have no reverb while snare has heavy reverb
- **Tempo-sync delay:** In KIT EDIT → DELAY → set "TempoSync" ON - delay time locks to tempo in note divisions (1/4, 1/8, 1/16, etc.)

## Why This Instrument Excels

### **ACB Digital Modeling Magic:**
- **Component-Level Circuit Modeling:** Not samples or simple algorithm - ACB analyzes original circuit boards transistor-by-transistor, models behavior at component level. 808 bass drum isn't WAV file - it's real-time synthesis of bridged T-network oscillator into VCA with tuning control. 909 snare isn't sample - it's noise generator through resonant filter with snap envelope. This level of modeling captures subtle interactions: how components affect each other, temperature-dependent behavior, power supply interactions. Result sounds and responds like analog even though it's digital processing.
- **Every Classic Roland Drum Machine:** TR-808 (hip-hop foundation, trap bass, vintage techno), TR-909 (house music standard, harder/punchier than 808), TR-707 (80s pop perfection, gated snare), TR-606 (compact sound for acid house), TR-727 (Latin percussion), CR-78 (first Roland rhythm machine). Six decades of drum machine history in one box. Each kit can mix sounds from different machines - 808 kick with 909 snare with 707 hats. Impossible with hardware originals.
- **User Sampling Expansion:** Beyond ACB models, import your own samples (WAV/AIFF up to ~180 seconds). Capture modular drums through interface, import to TR-8S, sequence alongside ACB sounds. Or import vinyl break chops, foley recordings, synthesized tones. TR-8S becomes hybrid: authentic vintage drum models PLUS unlimited custom sounds. Each kit has 11 instrument slots, each slot can be ACB voice OR user sample.
- **Deep Sound Editing:** Unlike sample-playback machines locked to presets, TR-8S allows extensive editing of ACB models. 808 bass drum: adjust tuning across multiple octaves (real 808 limited range), shape tone/attack/decay independently, route through onboard compression/distortion. 909 snare: control noise level, tune body, adjust snap amount, gate length. Editing responds in real-time like analog (turn knob, hear immediate response) but with digital recall (perfect settings save, no component drift).

### **Performance & Modular Integration:**
- **Six Trigger/Audio Assignable Outputs:** Front panel has 6 additional 1/4" outputs (beyond main mix) that can function as: (1) individual instrument audio outs (route bass drum to hardware compressor, snare to reverb pedal, separate mixing), (2) trigger outputs sending +5V gates to modular (bass drum pattern triggers modular bass synth envelope, snare pattern triggers modular filter ping). Switchable per jack via UTILITY menu. This is "Pairs Well With Modular" superpower - TR-8S rhythms directly control Eurorack/Buchla patches without MIDI-to-CV conversion.
- **Dedicated Mini Trigger Output:** Rear panel mini jack (separate from 6 assignable outs) sends programmable trigger track for master clock or unique rhythmic gates. Program unusual clock division in this trigger track (every 5 steps, every 13 steps), send to modular clock input, create polyrhythmic modular sequences. Or program kick drum variations in main BD track (audible drums) while trigger track sends every quarter note gate for rock-solid clock (modular ignores kick variations, locks to consistent pulse).
- **64-Step Sequencing Depth:** Patterns up to 64 steps (vs 16 on vintage machines) enables extended phrases, polymeter experiments, complex builds. Program 32-step verse, 16-step chorus, 48-step breakdown - structural arrangement within drum machine. Polymeter sets different loop lengths per instrument (bass drum 16 steps, snare 15 steps, hats 13 steps) creating phase-shifting patterns that evolve over many bars. Essential for modular integration where changing patterns are generative interest.
- **Extensive Performance Features:** Pattern chaining builds songs (chain patterns 1-1 → 1-2 → 1-3 → 1-4 with repeat counts, playback executes automatically). Scatter function adds controlled chaos (Scatter Depth knob controls intensity, Scatter Type button selects algorithm) for breakbeat variations. Step Repeat loops current step in real-time. Roll pads (pads [12]-[13]) create rolls on any drum. Autofill inserts programmed fills at regular intervals (every 4 bars, every 8 bars) or manual trigger. These are "play TR-8S live while modular drones" tools.
- **Motion Parameter Automation:** Record knob/fader movements per-step as automation data. Filter sweep opening over 32 steps (classic techno build), bass drum tuning dropping each hit (kick pitch envelope impossible on hardware 808), delay feedback increasing into chaos. Motion data saves with pattern, plays back automatically. This is "make drums evolve within pattern" not "drums are static loop."

### **Effects & Sound Design:**
- **Master FX Transformation:** Six stereo master effects processing entire kit: Distortion (analog-style clipping warmth), Fuzz (transistor-style saturation), Compressor (parallel compression punch), Bit Crusher (lo-fi digital reduction), Ring Mod (metallic inharmonic tones), Filter (resonant state-variable filtering). Master FX applied post-mix to entire drum mix, drastically changes character. Bit Crusher at 4-bit resolution creates vintage sampler aesthetic. Ring Mod creates industrial metallic drums. Compressor glues drums into cohesive punchy mix. [CTRL] knob provides real-time macro control over effect depth - perform Master FX sweeps during live sets.
- **Kit-Level Reverb & Delay:** Studio-quality effects per kit: multiple reverb algorithms (Room, Hall, Plate, Spring), multiple delay types (Single, Ping-Pong, Dual, Reverse, Shuffle, Delay+Reverb). Each instrument has independent send level to reverb/delay - bass drum bone dry, snare in huge hall, hats with short room. This is mix-level control integrated into drum machine, no external effects required.
- **Per-Instrument Processing:** Each instrument (each of 11 voices) has: Tune (pitch), Decay (length), Pan (stereo position), Gain (level), CTRL knob assigned to different parameters per instrument (filter cutoff, resonance, attack, compression, etc via CTRL SELECT menu). Additionally, samples have Start/End point editing, reverse playback, loop mode, gate behavior. This depth means "808 bass drum" isn't single sound - it's sound design starting point with massive tweaking potential.

### **Integration & Workflow:**
- **USB Audio/MIDI Interface:** Connect to computer via USB, TR-8S appears as: (1) USB audio interface (13 stereo input channels to DAW: 11 instruments + main mix + ext in), (2) USB MIDI device (sync to DAW tempo, record TR-8S sequences into DAW as MIDI, sequence TR-8S from DAW). Record each TR-8S drum to separate DAW track for individual processing (compress kick in DAW, gate reverb snare, sidechain bass to kick). Or use TR-8S as DAW drum brain - sequence drums in Ableton/Logic, TR-8S generates audio, stems route to DAW tracks for arrangement/mixing.
- **Pattern Library Management:** 128 patterns total (16 songs × 8 patterns per song × 1 set), storable patterns organized in bank/number structure for quick access. Pattern names editable (label "Verse," "Chorus," "Build," "Drop"). BACKUP function exports all patterns/kits/settings to SD card as single file for archival/sharing. RESTORE function imports backed-up data. Build extensive pattern library across projects, share pattern banks with collaborators, backup before experiments.
- **Hands-On Control:** Physical knobs/faders for every instrument, immediate tactile control without menu diving. Left-to-right layout: 11 instrument channels, each with TUNE/DECAY/CTRL knob + level fader + mute button. Effects section: Reverb/Delay/Master FX knobs. Performance section: 16 velocity-sensitive pads for step programming or real-time playing. This is "eyes on modular, hands on TR-8S" workflow - adjust drums without computer screen.

### **Perfect For:**
- **Modular System Drummers:** Eurorack/Buchla users needing structured rhythms for patches - TR-8S provides clock, triggers, rhythmic complexity that modular lacks
- **Live Electronic Performers:** Solo artists needing reliable drum foundation - TR-8S handles rhythm section while performer plays keys/synth/guitar over top
- **Hybrid Studio Producers:** Producers combining hardware + software - TR-8S generates authentic drum stems that route to DAW for arrangement/processing
- **Vintage Drum Machine Collectors (Budget Edition):** Want 808/909/707 sounds without $5,000+ vintage prices - TR-8S delivers ACB models at fraction of cost
- **Sample-Based Beatmakers:** Hip-hop/lo-fi producers needing sequencer for chopped breaks - import vinyl samples, sequence on TR-8S step sequencer, perform live
- **Techno/House Producers:** Dance music artists needing classic Roland drum sound with modern features - ACB 909 kick + contemporary effects + pattern chaining
- **Experimental/IDM Artists:** Electronic musicians exploring polymeter/generative rhythms - 64-step sequences, per-track last step, Scatter function creates evolving patterns

## What This Unlocks From Your Existing Gear

### **Transform Your Hermod+ & Modular System**

**Hermod+ as Master Clock with TR-8S as Rhythm Generator:**
- Clock Hermod+ from TR-8S: Connect TR-8S TRIGGER OUT (rear mini jack) to Hermod+ clock input → Set TR-8S SYNC MODE = INTERNAL (TR-8S is master) → Set Hermod+ to receive external clock → Now TR-8S controls tempo for entire Eurorack system
- Why this matters: Hermod+ excels at melodic sequencing (multiple CV tracks for oscillators/filters), TR-8S excels at rhythmic structure (64-step drum patterns with swing/shuffle). Separating clock (TR-8S) from melody (Hermod+) gives best of both worlds
- Advanced workflow: TR-8S sends master tempo via trigger out + individual drum triggers via ASSIGNABLE OUT 1-6 to modular envelope generators → Hermod+ sequences pitch CV to oscillators → TR-8S rhythms trigger modular envelope/VCA articulation → Hermod+ pitch + TR-8S rhythm = complex coordinated system

**Reverse: Hermod+ Clocks TR-8S:**
- Connect Hermod+ MIDI OUT to TR-8S MIDI IN via MIDI cable → Set TR-8S SYNC MODE = MIDI → Hermod+ controls master tempo → TR-8S follows
- Why reverse makes sense: If Hermod+ is sequencing complex polyrhythmic modular melodies with its own internal clock dividers/multipliers, making Hermod+ master keeps modular sequences tight
- Use case: Hermod+ sends clock + TR-8S plays drum patterns in sync + TR-8S individual triggers still control modular percussion voices = three-layer system

**TR-8S Triggers Modular Voices (Your Primary Workflow):**
1. Set ASSIGNABLE OUT 1-6 to TRIGGER mode: [UTILITY] → ASSIGN OUT 1: Mode → TRIGGER (repeat for 2-6)
2. Assign instruments to triggers: Hold [SHIFT] + [KIT] → OUTPUT section → BD → ASSIGN 1, SD → ASSIGN 2, CH → ASSIGN 3, OH → ASSIGN 4, etc
3. Connect: TR-8S ASSIGNABLE OUT 1 to modular VCA envelope input, OUT 2 to filter envelope, OUT 3 to second VCA, etc
4. Result: TR-8S bass drum pattern triggers modular bass voice (via VCA envelope), snare pattern triggers modular lead (via filter envelope), hat pattern triggers modular percussion (via another VCA) - structured rhythm from TR-8S controls chaotic modular voices

**Sampling Modular Drums Into TR-8S:**
1. Patch modular drum voice (kick/snare/hat from analog modules) to audio interface output
2. Record short drum hit as WAV file (0.5-3 seconds)
3. Copy WAV to SD card: ROLAND/TR-8S/SAMPLE/ folder
4. Insert SD card into TR-8S: [UTILITY] → Sample Import → select your modular drum file
5. Assign sample: [SAMPLE] → select imported sample → assign to instrument [BD]-[RC]
6. Now sequence modular-recorded drum alongside ACB 808/909 sounds
7. Result: Hybrid kit combining circuit-modeled classics with your unique modular percussion

**Create Generative Polyrhythms:**
- TR-8S polymeter (different loop lengths per instrument) triggers modular voices on shifting rhythmic relationships
- Example: TR-8S BD = 16 steps, SD = 15 steps, CH = 14 steps, each triggers different modular voice
- Modular voices phase against each other (16 vs 15 vs 14 creates 3360-step master cycle = 210 bars before exact repeat)
- Add TR-8S Scatter function for additional controlled randomization
- Result: Generative modular performance driven by TR-8S complex rhythms, never exactly repeats, human-impossible coordination

### **Enhance Your Audio Interface Capabilities**

Your audio interface becomes professional drum recording front-end:
- Route TR-8S via USB Audio: Shows as 13 stereo channels in DAW (11 instruments + main mix + ext in)
- Record each drum to separate DAW track: Kick on track 1, snare on track 2, hats on track 3, etc
- Process individually: Compress kick, gate reverb snare, parallel compress drums, surgical EQ per drum
- Non-destructive: Original TR-8S patterns remain, DAW processing is additional layer
- Workflow: Program drums on TR-8S hardware (fast/tactile) → Record stems to DAW (archival/editing) → Arrange/process in DAW (production/mixing)

### **Maximize Your Eurorack Case**

**What TR-8S Adds to Modular (That Modular Lacks):**
1. **Structured rhythm** - Modular excels at drones/textures/chaos, struggles with consistent drum programming. TR-8S provides rock-solid 16th-note precision
2. **Recall** - Modular patches are ephemeral (change patch, lose drums). TR-8S stores 128 patterns with perfect recall
3. **Swing/Shuffle** - Creating natural shuffle in modular requires complex clock divider patching. TR-8S has [SHUFFLE] knob
4. **Classic drum sounds** - Building authentic 808 kick in modular requires specific modules (sine VCO, decay envelope, pitch envelope, VCA). TR-8S provides authentic ACB models instantly
5. **Performance features** - Pattern chaining, fills, scatter, mutes - modular requires extensive planning. TR-8S has dedicated controls
6. **Multiple simultaneous rhythms** - 11 instruments with independent programming = 11 coordinated polyrhythmic trigger sources for modular (impossible without huge sequencer module)

**What Modular Adds to TR-8S (That TR-8S Lacks):**
1. **Analog warmth/saturation** - Route TR-8S through modular VCAs/filters for analog coloration
2. **Complex modulation** - Use modular LFOs/envelopes to CV-control... wait, TR-8S doesn't have CV inputs. Use MIDI CC from Hermod+ to modulate TR-8S parameters
3. **Generative variation** - Modular random/sample&hold can trigger TR-8S pattern changes via MIDI program change
4. **Analog drum voices** - Modular kick/snare triggered by TR-8S (via TRIGGER OUT) adds pure analog alongside digital ACB

**The Ideal Integration:**
TR-8S → Main mix to modular mixer (full drum mix in system) + Individual triggers (1-6) to modular envelope generators (TR-8S rhythms articulate modular voices) + Modular output back to TR-8S RETURN input (process modular through TR-8S reverb/delay) + Final mix to interface for recording = complete hardware ecosystem with TR-8S as rhythmic conductor

### **Transform Your Live Performance Setup**

**Solo Electronic Set (TR-8S + Modular):**
- TR-8S handles all drums (programmed patterns, live fills, scatter variations)
- Modular handles bass/lead/pads (sequenced by Hermod+, triggered by TR-8S)
- Your hands: Left on modular patch (adjust filters/levels/modulation), Right on TR-8S (mute/unmute drums, trigger fills, adjust swing)
- Audience sees: Hardware performance (not laptop), TR-8S LED feedback is visual interest
- Advantages over laptop: Tactile control, visual interest, reliable (no computer crashes), sounds better (actual circuit modeling + analog modular vs plugins)

**Practical 30-Minute Set Structure Using TR-8S:**
1. Intro (2 min): TR-8S Pattern 1-1 (minimal kick/hat), Hermod+ drone, modular filter sweeps
2. Build 1 (3 min): Pattern 1-2 adds snare, Scatter function increases, modular complexity builds  
3. Drop 1 (4 min): Pattern 1-3 full drums, TR-8S Master FX (bit crusher), modular bass enters
4. Breakdown 1 (3 min): Pattern 1-4 drums drop to kick/hat, TR-8S reverb increases, modular lead melody
5. Build 2 (3 min): Pattern 1-5 adds percussion, TR-8S fills via autofill, modular filter resonance rises
6. Drop 2 (4 min): Pattern 1-6 polyrhythmic drums (polymeter active), modular fully orchestrated
7. Transition (2 min): Pattern 2-1 switches kit (909 sounds now), modular reset to pads
8. [Continue through patterns 2-2 through 2-8 with similar structure]
9. Final drop (4 min): Pattern 8-8 maximum density, TR-8S scatter at full depth, modular chaos
10. Outro (2 min): Pattern 8-1 returns to minimal, gradual fadeout

This structure requires: Pre-programmed 8 songs × 8 patterns (64 total patterns), organized progression, practiced pattern/kit changes, Hermod+ sequences for each section. Result: 30-minute hardware set with narrative arc, no computer, all live-adjustable.
