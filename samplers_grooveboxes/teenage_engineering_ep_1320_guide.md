## Troubleshooting

**Sample Memory and Storage Issues:**
- **"Limited memory" warnings**: With 96MB used for built-in sounds and only 32MB for user samples, manage storage carefully
  - Solution: Delete unwanted samples using **erado** + **sonus** to remove currently selected sample
  - Note: Built-in ROM samples cannot be deleted
  - Use teenage.engineering web-based sample tool for file management (sounds are locked to device)

**Interface and Control Confusion:**
- **Latin-themed text making functions hard to locate**: The medieval labeling can slow workflow initially
  - Solution: Learn key terms: "Sonus" (sound selection), "Claves" (keys), "Tempus" (tempo)
  - Reference the included manual for complete Latin-to-function translations
  - Practice common operations until medieval terminology becomes second nature

**Audio Quality and Performance:**
- **Built-in speaker insufficient for serious listening**: Internal speaker only for portability and initial exploration
  - Solution: Use headphones or external speakers for actual music production
  - Connect to powered monitors via stereo line output for studio monitoring

**MIDI and Sync Problems:**
- **External gear sync issues**: MIDI timing problems with DAWs or other equipment
  - Solution: Verify MIDI in/out connections and check sync settings in codex menu
  - Use USB-C for both power and MIDI data when connecting to computers
  - Check tempo matching between EP-1320 and external equipment

**Sample Transfer Difficulties:**
- **File transfer tool not working**: Computer connectivity issues with sample management
  - Solution: Ensure proper USB-C connection and navigate to teenage.engineering/apps/ep-sample-tool
  - Verify device appears in file transfer interface for audio file uploads
  - Use supported audio formats for successful sample import
