# Generative NiftyCase Version 1: Build & Organization Guide

## PHYSICAL MODULE LAYOUT (84HP NiftyCase)

### Optimal Left-to-Right Arrangement
```
[EC V2] [MARBLES] [TURING] [PLAITS] [POLIVOKS] [ochd] [RUINA] [DST] [MULT] [VCA]
  10HP    18HP     10HP     12HP     10HP      4HP    10HP   4HP   4HP   2HP
```

### Layout Rationale:

**LEFT SECTION - Clock & Generative Sources (38HP):**
- **Euclidian Circles V2 (10HP)** - Master clock + 6-channel euclidean rhythm generator
- **Marbles (18HP)** - Primary random source, needs easy access to all outputs
- **Turing Machine (10HP)** - Secondary random, compact but important

**CENTER SECTION - Sound Generation & Processing (22HP):**
- **Plaits (12HP)** - Main voice, receives CV from left section
- **Black Polivoks VCF (10HP)** - Aggressive analog filter with character

**RIGHT SECTION - Modulation, Effects & Utilities (24HP):**
- **ochd (4HP)** - Slow modulation source, small but mighty
- **Ruina Versio (10HP)** - Final effects processing
- **Disting mk4 (4HP)** - Additional envelope generator or effects processor, algorithm-switchable
- **Multiple mults (4HP)** - Signal distribution
- **Pico VCA2 (2HP)** - Compact amplitude control

## POWER CONSUMPTION ANALYSIS

### NiftyCase Power Supply: 1500mA @ +12V, 500mA @ -12V

| Module | +12V | -12V | Notes |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Euclidian Circles V2** | 0mA | 0mA | 5V only: 70-160mA (LED brightness dependent) |
| **Marbles** | 130mA | 20mA | High +12V for digital processing |
| **Turing Machine** | 40mA | 5mA | Simple analog circuit |
| **Plaits** | 85mA | 15mA | Digital oscillator |
| **Black Polivoks VCF** | 80mA | 80mA | Analog filter circuit |
| **ochd** | 80mA | 80mA | Balanced LFO circuit |
| **Ruina Versio** | 150mA | 25mA | DSP effects processor |
| **Disting mk4** | 80mA | 15mA | Micro computer |
| **Multiple Mults** | 0mA | 0mA | Passive circuits |
| **Pico VCA2** | 10mA | 10mA | Simple analog VCA |
| **TOTAL** | **655mA** | **250mA** | **Safe margins** |

**Power Headroom:** +12V: 845mA remaining (56%), -12V: 250mA remaining (50%)
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Plenty of headroom for stable operation

### **Master Clock Configuration - Euclidian Circles V2:**
- **Internal clock range:** 10-2500 BPM
- **No numeric BPM display** - tempo setting is by feel/ear using middle encoder
- **Setting tempo:** Long press middle encoder to enter AUTO CLOCK mode, rotate clockwise to increase speed
- **Tap tempo function:** Most precise method for setting specific BPMs (use F-BUTTON)
- **Visual feedback:** LED rings show pattern activity but not numeric BPM
- **Recommendation:** Use tap tempo for precise BPM matching with other equipment

## CABLE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

### Cable Requirements by Type:
- **Long cables (12"+):** 8-10 pieces (cross-case routing)
- **Medium cables (6-8"):** 10-12 pieces (adjacent modules)
- **Short cables (3-4"):** 6-8 pieces (tight connections)
- **Stackable cables:** 4-6 pieces (mult splitting)

### Cable Organization by Function:

**RED cables - Clock/Trigger signals:**
- Euclidian Circles V2 outputs → Marbles, Turing, Plaits triggers
- EC V2 master clock → system timing
- Marbles t1,t2,t3 → various trigger inputs
- Cross-modulation trigger signals

**BLUE cables - Pitch CV:**
- Marbles X,Y → Plaits V/OCT, Disting quantizer
- Turing CV → Plaits pitch, filter cutoff
- Disting quantized outputs → pitch destinations

**YELLOW cables - Modulation CV:**
- ochd outputs → various mod inputs (filter, effects, etc.)
- Cross-modulation between Marbles, Turing, EC V2
- Slow parameter automation signals

**BLACK cables - Audio:**
- Plaits → Black Polivoks VCF → Ruina Versio → Output
- VCA in audio path for amplitude control

### Physical Cable Routing:
```
TOP RAIL: Long clock and CV cables
MID SPACE: Audio cables and medium CV
BOTTOM: Short local connections and power
```

## BUILD SEQUENCE & TESTING

### Phase 1: Power & Basic Setup
1. **Install power cable** in NiftyCase
2. **Mount modules** left-to-right in layout order
3. **Power on test** - verify all modules boot correctly
4. **Check current draw** with multimeter if available

### Phase 2: Basic Signal Chain
1. **Master clock setup:**
   - Set Euclidian Circles V2 to AUTO CLOCK mode
   - Use tap tempo (F-BUTTON) to set desired BPM
   - Test clock outputs from EC V2
2. **Audio path first:**
   - Plaits → Black Polivoks VCF → Ruina Versio → NiftyCase output
   - Test with Plaits internal trigger, verify audio flow
3. **Basic rhythm:**
   - EC V2 channel 1 → Plaits trigger
   - Verify rhythmic audio output with euclidean patterns

### Phase 3: Generative Network
1. **Add Marbles:**
   - EC V2 channel 2 → Marbles clock input
   - Marbles X → Plaits V/OCT
   - Test random pitch sequences
2. **Add Turing Machine:**
   - EC V2 channel 3 → Turing clock
   - Turing CV → Black Polivoks cutoff
   - Verify filter modulation
3. **Add cross-modulation:**
   - Turing CV → Marbles bias
   - Marbles Y → EC V2 reset (if desired)
   - Test interaction between random sources

### Phase 4: Deep Modulation & Effects
1. **Disting envelope generation:**
   - Configure Disting to ADSR or Dual AR algorithm
   - EC V2 gates → Disting envelope triggers
   - Disting envelope outputs → VCA CV, filter modulation
2. **ochd modulation:**
   - Connect remaining ochd outputs to various parameters
   - Test slow evolution of sound
3. **Disting effects processing:**
   - Switch Disting to delay/reverb/distortion algorithms as desired
   - Insert in audio chain: Plaits → Disting effects → Polivoks → Ruina Versio
   - Experiment with serial effects processing

## PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### Session Preparation:

4. **Initialize randomness:** Set Marbles/Bloom to known states

### Live Performance Setup:
- **Minimal cables on top** - avoid tangling
- **Essential controls marked** - tape or labels for key parameters
- **Backup patches documented** - quick recovery from issues
- **Audio monitoring** - always have headphones connected

### Recording Considerations:
- **Long session recordings** - capture evolution over time
- **Multiple takes** - generative systems vary each performance
- **Document settings** - recreate interesting moments
- **Layer building** - record multiple passes for complexity

## EXPANSION POSSIBILITIES

### Future NiftyCase Additions:
If you build additional cases, these modules would complement perfectly:

**Rhythmic Expansion:**
- Euclidean Circles → Additional rhythm complexity
- Numeric Repetitor → Clock division variations

**Harmonic Expansion:**
- Rings → Add resonant tones
- Additional VCAs → More dynamic control

**Processing Expansion:**
- MISO → Analog delay character
- Additional filters → Parallel processing

### Integration with Larger System:
- **Clock sync** - Use as master or slave to larger system
- **CV expansion** - Share random sources with other cases  
- **Audio processing** - Feed output to larger mixing/effects setup
- **MIDI integration** - Disting can provide MIDI-to-CV conversion

This build creates a complete, self-contained generative music system that's both powerful and manageable. The careful organization ensures reliable operation and encourages exploration while maintaining the ability to recreate successful patches.
