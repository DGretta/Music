# Generative NiftyCase: Build & Organization Guide

## PHYSICAL MODULE LAYOUT (84HP NiftyCase)

### Optimal Left-to-Right Arrangement
```
[MARBLES] [BLOOM] [TURING] [PLAITS] [MOB EMUS] [ochd] [RUINA] [DST] [MULT]
   18HP     16HP    10HP     12HP     16HP     4HP    10HP   4HP   2HP
```

### Layout Rationale:

**LEFT SECTION - Generative Sources (44HP):**
- **Marbles (18HP)** - Primary random source, needs easy access to all outputs
- **Bloom (16HP)** - Algorithmic sequencer, many CV outputs to route
- **Turing Machine (10HP)** - Secondary random, compact but important

**CENTER SECTION - Sound Generation (28HP):**
- **Plaits (12HP)** - Main voice, receives CV from left section
- **Mob of Emus (16HP)** - Filter/processor, large but central to sound shaping

**RIGHT SECTION - Modulation & Effects (12HP):**
- **ochd (4HP)** - Slow modulation source, small but mighty
- **Ruina Versio (10HP)** - Final effects processing
- **Disting mk4 (4HP)** - Utility, easily accessible for mode changes
- **2hp Mult (2HP)** - Signal distribution, small footprint

## POWER CONSUMPTION ANALYSIS

### NiftyCase Power Supply: 1500mA @ +12V, 500mA @ -12V

| Module | +12V | -12V | Notes |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Marbles** | 130mA | 20mA | High +12V for digital processing |
| **Bloom** | 150mA | 25mA | Sequencer with display |
| **Turing Machine** | 40mA | 5mA | Simple analog circuit |
| **Plaits** | 85mA | 15mA | Digital oscillator |
| **Mob of Emus** | 130mA | 30mA | Complex analog filter |
| **ochd** | 80mA | 80mA | Balanced LFO circuit |
| **Ruina Versio** | 150mA | 25mA | DSP effects processor |
| **Disting mk4** | 80mA | 15mA | Micro computer |
| **2hp Mult** | 0mA | 0mA | Passive circuit |
| **TOTAL** | **845mA** | **215mA** | **Safe margins** |

**Power Headroom:** +12V: 655mA remaining (44%), -12V: 285mA remaining (57%)
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Plenty of headroom for stable operation

## CABLE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

### Cable Requirements by Type:
- **Long cables (12"+):** 8-10 pieces (cross-case routing)
- **Medium cables (6-8"):** 10-12 pieces (adjacent modules)
- **Short cables (3-4"):** 6-8 pieces (tight connections)
- **Stackable cables:** 4-6 pieces (mult splitting)

### Cable Organization by Function:

**RED cables - Clock/Trigger signals:**
- ochd → Marbles rate
- Marbles t1,t2,t3 → Bloom, Turing, Plaits
- Bloom gates → various triggers

**BLUE cables - Pitch CV:**
- Marbles X,Y → Plaits V/OCT, Disting
- Bloom CV → Disting → Plaits
- Turing CV → Plaits, filter

**YELLOW cables - Modulation CV:**
- ochd outputs → various mod inputs
- Cross-modulation between generators

**BLACK cables - Audio:**
- Plaits → Mob of Emus → Ruina Versio → Output

### Physical Cable Routing:
```
TOP RAIL: Long clock and CV cables
MID SPACE: Audio cables and medium CV
BOTTOM: Short local connections and power
```

## BUILD SEQUENCE & TESTING

### Phase 1: Power & Basic Setup
1. **Install power cable** in NiftyCase
2. **Mount modules** left-to-right in layout order
3. **Power on test** - verify all modules boot correctly
4. **Check current draw** with multimeter if available

### Phase 2: Basic Signal Chain
1. **Audio path first:**
   - Plaits → Mob of Emus → Ruina Versio → NiftyCase output
   - Test with Plaits internal trigger, verify audio flow
2. **Basic clock:**
   - ochd OUT1 → Marbles rate
   - Marbles t1 → Plaits trigger
   - Verify rhythmic audio output

### Phase 3: Generative Network
1. **Add Bloom:**
   - Marbles t2 → Bloom clock
   - Bloom CV1 → Plaits V/OCT
   - Test melodic sequences
2. **Add Turing Machine:**
   - Marbles t3 → Turing clock
   - Turing CV → Mob of Emus cutoff
   - Verify filter modulation
3. **Add cross-modulation:**
   - Turing CV → Marbles bias
   - Bloom gate → various modulation inputs

### Phase 4: Deep Modulation
1. **ochd modulation:**
   - Connect remaining ochd outputs to various parameters
   - Test slow evolution of sound
2. **Disting utility:**
   - Configure as quantizer for pitch CV
   - Test other algorithms as needed

## PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### Session Preparation:
1. **Power on sequence:** Case first, then modules initialize
2. **Quick test patch:** Verify all modules responding
3. **Set ochd tempo:** Establish base timing
4. **Initialize randomness:** Set Marbles/Bloom to known states

### Live Performance Setup:
- **Minimal cables on top** - avoid tangling
- **Essential controls marked** - tape or labels for key parameters
- **Backup patches documented** - quick recovery from issues
- **Audio monitoring** - always have headphones connected

### Recording Considerations:
- **Long session recordings** - capture evolution over time
- **Multiple takes** - generative systems vary each performance
- **Document settings** - recreate interesting moments
- **Layer building** - record multiple passes for complexity

## EXPANSION POSSIBILITIES

### Future NiftyCase Additions:
If you build additional cases, these modules would complement perfectly:

**Rhythmic Expansion:**
- Euclidean Circles → Additional rhythm complexity
- Numeric Repetitor → Clock division variations

**Harmonic Expansion:**
- Rings → Add resonant tones
- Additional VCAs → More dynamic control

**Processing Expansion:**
- MISO → Analog delay character
- Additional filters → Parallel processing

### Integration with Larger System:
- **Clock sync** - Use as master or slave to larger system
- **CV expansion** - Share random sources with other cases  
- **Audio processing** - Feed output to larger mixing/effects setup
- **MIDI integration** - Disting can provide MIDI-to-CV conversion

This build creates a complete, self-contained generative music system that's both powerful and manageable. The careful organization ensures reliable operation and encourages exploration while maintaining the ability to recreate successful patches.
