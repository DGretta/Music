# Squarp Hermod+ - Beginner's Guide

**The Modular System Brain**

---

## Quick Start: Get Your First Sequence in 5 Minutes

**What is Hermod+?** Think of it as the central nervous system for your entire studio - modular and beyond. It's a 16-track sequencer (8 CV/Gate + 8 MIDI) that bridges the gap between your Eurorack system, MIDI gear, and computer. With high-resolution recording, real-time effects, and an intuitive workflow, it's like having a powerful DAW in 26HP.

### Your First Basic Sequence
1. **Connect CV/Gate outputs** ‚Üí **Track 1 CV to oscillator V/OCT**, **Track 1 Gate to envelope**
2. **Press STEP button** to enter Step Mode (LED lights up)
3. **Press Track 1 button** to select it (LED lights up)
4. **Use grid buttons** to enter notes - press and hold while turning encoder
5. **Press PLAY** and watch your sequence come alive!
6. **Press TRACKS button** to mute/unmute and control levels

**Congratulations!** You've just programmed your first sequence in the brain of your modular system!

## Beginner Patch Ideas

### **Patch 1: Basic Eurorack Sequence**
```
[Hermod+ Track 1 CV] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Oscillator V/OCT]
[Hermod+ Track 1 GATE] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Envelope Generator GATE]
[Envelope out] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [VCA CV input]
[Oscillator] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [VCA Audio input]
```
**Mode:** STEP mode to program, TRACKS mode to play
**Setup:** Program 8-16 step melody, use grid buttons + encoder
**Visual:** Track 1 LED shows activity, grid shows current step
**Result:** Classic sequenced synthesizer voice with full control

### **Patch 2: Polyrhythmic Multi-Track**
```
[Hermod+ Track 1] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Bass Oscillator] (16 steps)
[Hermod+ Track 2] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Lead Oscillator] (12 steps)
[Hermod+ Track 3] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Drum Module] (8 steps)
[External Clock] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Hermod+ Clock input]
```
**Mode:** Use TRACKS mode to manage multiple tracks
**Setup:** Different track lengths create evolving polyrhythms
**Visual:** Multiple track LEDs show independent activity patterns
**Result:** Complex interlocking rhythms that phase in and out

### **Patch 3: MIDI + CV Hybrid System**
```
[Hermod+ MIDI Track 9] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [External MIDI Synth]
[Hermod+ CV Track 1] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Eurorack Oscillator]
[USB] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Computer/DAW synchronization]
```
**Mode:** STEP mode programs both MIDI and CV simultaneously
**Setup:** Sequence external gear alongside modular - perfect hybrid setup
**Visual:** Different colored LEDs distinguish MIDI vs CV tracks
**Result:** Unified control of entire studio from one brain

### **Patch 4: Effects Processing Showcase**
```
[Hermod+ Track 1 CV] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Oscillator V/OCT]
[Hermod+ Track 1 GATE] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [LPG GATE input]
Enable: [Ratchet + Swing + Random effects]
```
**Mode:** EFFECTS mode to add real-time processing
**Setup:** Simple 4-note pattern transformed by stacked effects
**Visual:** Effects LEDs show active processing
**Result:** Simple sequence becomes complex, groovy, and unpredictable

## Beginner "Gotchas"

### **Mode Confusion - The Four-Button System**
- **Only one mode active at a time** - check which mode button is lit
- **STEP mode = programming**, **TRACKS mode = performance**, **EFFECTS mode = sound design**, **SEQ mode = arrangement**
- **Different mode, different encoder function** - same knob does different things
- **Start in STEP mode** for programming, switch to TRACKS for performance
- **Mode buttons are your navigation** - learn to switch fluidly between them

### **Track vs Pattern vs Sequence Hierarchy**
- **Track:** One voice/instrument (like Track 1 = bass line)
- **Pattern:** Variation of a track (Track 1 can have 16 different bass patterns)
- **Sequence:** Collection of all track patterns playing together (like verse/chorus)
- **Project:** Complete song with multiple sequences
- **Think:** Track = instrument, Pattern = verse/chorus variation, Sequence = song section

### **CV/Gate Track Configuration**
- **Default:** Tracks 1-8 output CV/Gate for Eurorack
- **Can be reconfigured:** Add velocity, aftertouch, or make polyphonic
- **Voice grouping:** Multiple CV outputs can be combined for poly
- **MIDI tracks (9-16)** don't have CV outputs - they're MIDI only
- **Check track type** before patching - CV tracks have physical outputs

### **Recording vs Programming Confusion**
- **Two ways to get notes in:** Live recording or step programming
- **Recording:** Play live (keyboard/CV) while sequencer records
- **Programming:** Use STEP mode to manually place notes
- **Recording requires input source** - keyboard, CV, or MIDI controller
- **Programming uses built-in editor** - no external controller needed

### **Effects Apply Per Track**
- **Each track has independent effects** - Track 1 ratchet doesn't affect Track 2
- **Up to 8 effects per track** - can stack multiple effects
- **Effects work on both CV and MIDI tracks** - but behave differently
- **Effect order matters** - arpeggiator before ratchet = different result
- **Start with one effect** - understand each before stacking

## Next Steps

1. **Master the four modes** - understand when to use STEP vs TRACKS vs EFFECTS vs SEQ
2. **Explore track configurations** - try mono, poly, velocity, and modulation setups
3. **Experiment with effects** - start with quantize and ratchet, then explore combinations
4. **Build song structures** - use patterns and sequences for complete compositions
5. **Integrate external gear** - connect MIDI devices and use USB for DAW sync
6. **Learn advanced recording** - capture live performances with 96PPQ precision

**Remember:** Hermod+ is deep - it can replace multiple modules and be the brain of your entire setup. Start simple and gradually explore its vast capabilities!
