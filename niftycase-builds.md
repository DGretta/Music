## 3. GENERATIVE/ALGORITHMIC MUSIC (REVISED)
**Total: 84HP** *(Perfect fit)*

| Module | HP | Function |
|--------|----|-----------| 
| **Mutable Instruments Marbles** | 18 | Random gates & voltages |
| **Qu-Bit Electronix Bloom V1** | 16 | Algorithmic sequencer |

| **Expert Sleepers Disting mk4** | 4 | Quantizer/utility |
| **2hp Mult** | 2 | Signal distribution |

**Why this revised version works better for Generative:**
- Marbles provides controlled randomness for gates and pitch
- Bloom creates evolving, branching sequences that interact with Marbles
- Turing Machine adds a third layer of controlled chaos
- Plaits offers diverse synthesis methods responding to generative CV
- **Mob of Emus** filters and shapes the generative sequences with incredible sonic variety
- **ochd** provides slow, complex LFOs perfect for gradual parameter changes
- **Ruina Versio** adds spatial effects and can create feedback loops for more complexity
- Disting handles quantization and CV processing utilities
- Mult allows the random voltages to control multiple parameters simultaneously

**Key Improvement:** This build now has proper signal flow: Generative sources → Synthesis → Filtering → Effects, creating much more musically complete results.
